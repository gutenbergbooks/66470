<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p>It is not my intention in my prison diary to discuss
the constitutional or legal question of arbitrary arrests
and imprisonment of non-combatants, but to present
to my readers a picture of the daily routine of prison
life as I saw it, together with incidents related to me
by fellow-prisoners.</p>

<p>Conditions in the Old Capitol differed in many respects
from the prison camps. Prisoners in the Old
Capitol were mostly civilians, except where soldiers
(either prisoners of war or men charged with
offenses), were brought in and kept until they could
be sent to places designated; or prisoners from other
prisons held over until they could be shipped South
for exchange.</p>

<p>In the itinerary of our journey from Parole Camp
to Upperville I have given little details which to some
may seem trivial and unworthy of note, but I give
them to show existing conditions in sections of the
Confederacy through which we passed.</p>

<p>I do not feel that I am straying from the subject
of this narrative of prison experience in appending
some facts concerning the treatment of prisoners of
war. It is only by laying before the people a frank
and faithful statement that we can overcome prejudice
and hostile feeling, and bring about that hearty reunion
which is earnestly desired by all who have the peace
and prosperity of the country at heart.</p>

<p>I have before me a report of a sermon from the
New York <i>Press</i>, May, 1909, in which a minister of
the Gospel (?) residing within the limits of Greater
New York speaks of &#8220;<i>the infamous Captain Wirz</i>&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;<i>a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[iv]</span>
murderer</i>.&#8221; It is charitable to attribute such language
from the lips of a minister to ignorance rather than
malice. Yet, while persons are found who entertain
and publicly express such sentiments, I cannot be open
to the charge of desiring to awaken and perpetuate
bitter memories if I seek to place on record the true
history of Major Wirz, to refute the falsehoods and
misrepresentations which have crept into history and
are still believed by some.</p>

<p>When the grave questions which for years agitated
our country had reached the crisis, and there remained
but the <i>ultima ratio regum</i>, they were submitted to the
arbitrament of the battlefield. We of the South accepted
the result of that contest and laid down our
arms in good faith. But when we are asked, like a
whipped child, to say we were wrong and are sorry for
what we did, and promise to sin no more, it is asking
too much. We fought for what we considered our
rights, and lost. Yet our men, who fought and lost,
and those who died in the struggle, were just as brave
and as honest as the men who wore the blue. <i>They</i>
fought for the Union, <i>we</i> fought for our homes, for
our wives and our dear ones. For those of our dead
who were consigned to death and ignominy we do not
ask pity, but only for that justice which was denied
them in life&mdash;that the blot upon their reputations be
effaced and their names stand out clear and stainless.</p>

<p>The little episode in relation to the Fairfax Court
House raid will need no apology for its introduction,
as I have already had occasion to refer to that affair
in my diary.</p>

<p>The illustrations here given are from drawings
made by my son, B. F. Williamson.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTORY</h2>
</div>


<p>Prison life was much the same North or South in
its general features, having its discomforts and privations,
its days of worry, its longings and its disappointments,
combined with that chafing under restraint,
which is a feeling common to all men. Yet the sufferings
of prisoners could have been alleviated in the
North to a greater degree than was possible at the
South, where in most cases the distress was due to
lack of means to relieve it. The Confederate Government
could not do for Federal prisoners what it was
unable to do for its own soldiers or people.</p>

<p>It is not strange that when the flood of war swept
over the country I should plunge into its turbulent
waters and be carried along with the current. This
martial spirit was inherited and fostered from the
cradle up. My grandmother came to this country
from Ireland in the stormy days of the rebellion of
1798. When but a little child I would sit by her side
for hours, drinking in, like a heated, thirsty traveler,
the wild stories of the exciting scenes she had witnessed
there, and listening to the pathetic recital of
the wrongs of her loved country and its people. And
at night I would drop off to sleep on her lap with the
old Irish rebel songs of &#8217;98 murmuring a lullaby in
my baby ears.</p>

<p>It was only natural, too, that I should be enlisted
on the Southern side. I was born in Baltimore, and
it was there I passed the early years of my life. My
father, James J. Williamson, had the distinction of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
designing and building the first clipper ship ever constructed&mdash;the
clipper ship <i>Ann McKim</i>, built in Baltimore
in 1832, for the old house of Isaac McKim, of
Baltimore. The history of Maryland, with the record
of the heroic deeds of the Old Maryland Line in the
War of the Revolution, had always possessed a charm
for me above all other books. It was my greatest
pride to know that I was a Marylander and that
Baltimore was my home.</p>

<p>When I became of age I went to Washington and
obtained a position in the Government Printing Office,
where I remained until the breaking out of the war.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1861, the Federal troops were ordered
to march on Washington. When the Sixth
Massachusetts Regiment was attacked while passing
through Baltimore, I was ill, in bed and under the
doctor&#8217;s care. The next day my mother brought into
my room the morning paper and read to me an account
of the fighting in Baltimore, and of the threats
made to invade my native State and bombard and
destroy Baltimore. I felt all the youthful fire within
me blazing with fury. The warm blood coursing in
my veins carried with it a force which seemed to give
an almost unnatural strength to my feeble body,
weakened by a painful illness. I was seized with a
desire to rush at once to the scene of action. I felt
that the bed was no place for me&mdash;that I must rouse
myself to meet the issue&mdash;that my dear old mother
State was calling for her sons, and I would not let
that call go unheeded, but must hasten on to help
guard that sacred soil upon which I had received my
being and in which reposed the ashes of those who
were most near and dear to me. I felt all that enthusiasm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
with which the Southern hearts were filled when
their States were invaded and their cities and their
homes laid waste. Old Maryland was invaded&mdash;I did
not care by whom&mdash;for whoever came with hostile
intent was an enemy, and her enemies were mine.</p>

<p>I said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to Baltimore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When?&#8221; asked my mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will start to-morrow morning.&#8221; My mother left
the room without reply to what she thought were
idle words.</p>

<p>When the doctor came for his morning visit, my
mother said:</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think this boy says? He says he is
going to Baltimore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him go,&#8221; said the doctor, with an incredulous
smile.</p>

<p>The next morning when he came, expecting to find
me in bed, my mother said: &#8220;Well, Doctor, he has
gone to Baltimore.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head, and replied, &#8220;It will
either kill or cure him.&#8221; And it cured him. The day
I left my bed I went to Baltimore, and a week after
that I was in Richmond.</p>

<p>When I reached Baltimore trains were running to
and from the city without interruption, but troops
were being rushed to Washington, and it was seen
that Baltimore would soon be surrounded and hemmed
in by Federal troops, and it would then be difficult
to leave the city, so I left for Harper&#8217;s Ferry, where
I understood a body of Confederate troops were
already in camp. From Harper&#8217;s Ferry I went, via
Strasburg, to Manassas. There I found a few regiments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
of Confederates assembled. From Manassas I
started on train for Richmond.</p>

<p>Between Culpeper and Orange Court House we unfortunately
came in collision with a train carrying
infantry and a battery of artillery to Manassas. Both
trains were on the same track and coming from opposite
directions. There was a head-on collision; the
two engines crashed into each other and the cars
telescoped. There were fourteen killed outright and
a great number wounded, many fatally.</p>

<p>I was sitting in the rear car, talking to a man who
stood holding on to the rear door of the car. When I
felt the shock I saw him shoot past me and down the
aisle, between the seats. That night, when I arrived
at Gordonsville, I went to a house, seeking lodgings
for the night, and to my surprise, when the door was
opened and the gentleman of the house stood before
me, although his head was bandaged and his arm
in a sling, I recognized in him the man I was conversing
with at the time of the accident.</p>

<p>In Richmond I found a number of acquaintances
from Baltimore. A great many young men were coming
in from Maryland, some of whom had been comrades
in military companies in Baltimore, and soon a
couple of companies were organized to be united to a
regiment then forming at Harper&#8217;s Ferry, which afterward
gained honorable distinction as the First Maryland
Regiment.</p>

<p>Richmond had already put on a military air. In
the throngs on the streets a major part of the male
population appeared in stylish uniforms. These were
the gay days in Richmond.</p>

<p>Troops were arriving from the South and West,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
passing through on their way to the seat of war. I
was particularly struck with the appearance of the
Louisiana troops in their holiday dress, marching
proudly along, with bands playing inspiring martial
airs; the drum-major leading off with stately tread,
waving his staff. Tripping gaily after came the
sprightly vivandieres, their dainty little caps tipped
saucily to one side, their shapely ankles peeping from
beneath the folds of their short skirts, and the little
keg at their side hanging by a fancy cord thrown over
the shoulder.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the war the men came out as
they had been accustomed to &#8220;play soldiers&#8221;&mdash;attired
in gaudy uniforms, with gay colors, bright, shining
gun barrels and flashing bayonets. The Zouaves with
their red breeches, their red caps or turbans, their gilt
braids and chevrons.</p>

<p>These soon gave way to less showy trappings. The
jaunty caps were exchanged for the Kossuth felt hat,
the showy jackets, with their rich gilt braid and trimmings,
were replaced by the unpretentious blouse, and
the flaming red breeches were now conspicuous by
their absence, and in their stead comfortable, though
less attractive, garments were worn.</p>

<p>The bright gun barrels and flashing bayonets even
were found to be no more efficient than those dulled
by age and use, whose somber hue did not present such
a shining mark for a watchful sharpshooter.</p>

<p>In the house where I had taken board there was a
gentleman who was employed in the printing office
doing the work of the State and Confederate Governments.
Learning that I had been in the Government
Printing Office in Washington, he said they would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
glad to have me at this office. I told him I expected
to join my friends from Baltimore; that we were anxious
to be together in the Confederate army. He
said, &#8220;You can be of service on this work just now,
and we are badly in want of help.&#8221; I accordingly went
to Ritchie &amp; Dunnavant&#8217;s, the parties having charge
of this work.</p>

<p>Soon after this my wife ran the blockade and joined
me in Richmond.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_016.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">CERTIFICATE OF EXEMPTION<br />

These were furnished to save annoyance from provost-guards or
Conscript officers.</p>

<p>After a time, owing to the strict blockade, the fighting
around Richmond, and the scarcity of the necessaries
of life, the sufferings of the people were becoming
more serious every day. I felt that while it
was a matter of love and duty on my part to endure
these hardships without murmuring, and to contribute
all my efforts to the attainment of the success of our
cause, still I had no right to impose upon others an
amount of distress which they were not called upon
to undergo, and which could in no wise aid in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
accomplishment of that object, but was simply adding
to the number of non-combatants who were consuming
the scanty store of supplies without contributing to
their increase.</p>

<p>Taking this view of the situation, I decided to run
the blockade, and after getting my wife and children
safely outside of the lines, where they would be properly
cared for and have those comforts which I could not
obtain for them in Richmond, I could then take chances
for my return to the scene of duty.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_017.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">PASS THROUGH CONFEDERATE LINES</p>

<p>I procured a pass for myself, wife and children
through the Confederate lines, and, traveling in the
most primitive fashion, striking out from Hanover
Junction, crossed the Rappahannock River, and reached
Westmoreland Court House one summer evening, in
an ox-cart. We waited at the Potomac River for a
favorable opportunity to cross without too great risk
of capture by one of the United States gunboats
patroling the river, and then crossed in an open boat
to Stone&#8217;s Landing, on the Maryland side. Here we
were very comfortable, with a nice breakfast of fish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
and oysters fresh from the water, until the steamboat
came along which was to take us to Washington.
There were a number of Union officers and soldiers on
the boat, but having my wife and little children with
me I suppose averted whatever suspicion they might
otherwise have entertained, and we reached Washington
without any mishap.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PRISON LIFE IN THE OLD CAPITOL</h2>
</div>


<p>On the evening of Saturday, January 31, 1863, between
seven and eight o&#8217;clock, an officer in full uniform,
but unarmed, came into a bookstore on Seventh
Street, Washington, D. C., where I was then engaged,
and asked for the proprietor, Mr. Russell. I pointed
out Russell. The officer then asked him if he knew a
Mr. Williamson. Russell answered, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he a printer?&#8221; asked the officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he the only one of that name that you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There he is,&#8221; answered Russell, pointing toward
me.</p>

<p>The officer walked over to me and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir, you will have to come along with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>He then went to the door and called in a soldier
he had left standing guard outside, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Take charge of that man.&#8221;</p>

<p>I asked the officer if I would be permitted to call at
my home in order to acquaint my family with the cause
of my absence. He said I would not; that I must go
to the Provost-Marshal&#8217;s office. I obtained permission
to send a note to my wife, stating that I was under
arrest. Putting on my hat and coat, I was marched
to the corner of Eighth Street and Pennsylvania Avenue.
Here we halted, and the officer called out to
another soldier, who stood there holding his sword,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
which he took from the man and buckled on. Placing
me between the two guards, we all marched up Pennsylvania
Avenue to the Provost-Marshal&#8217;s office. The
Marshal was not in, but his assistant said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you belong in Washington?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you been South lately?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I said; &#8220;I came from Richmond on the
third of last August.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you reported yourself to the military authorities?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not.&#8221;</p>

<p>He next asked me if I would take the oath of allegiance
to the Government. I told him I would not;
that I could not think of doing so. He said I would
have time enough to think about it, as it might be
necessary to do so before I could obtain my release.
That I was charged with having been in Richmond,
and also with being accessory to the imprisonment of
some Union citizens.</p>

<p>I again asked if I would be permitted to go home
under escort of a guard, so as to acquaint my family
with the cause of my absence and also to get a change
of clothing and some few articles necessary for me
during the time I might be kept under arrest. This
request was denied, and I was marched off under
guard to the Old Capitol Prison, at the corner of
First and A Streets.</p>

<p>The building known as the Old Capitol had a memorable
history. Built in 1800, it was originally designed
for a tavern or boarding-house, but owing to
bad management it proved a failure and was closed
shortly before the War of 1812.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>In August, 1814, when the British troops under
General Ross entered Washington, they burned the
Capitol and other public buildings, and the Government
bought this old tavern or boarding-house, in
which Congress should hold their sessions and public
business be transacted until the Capitol could be
rebuilt.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_021.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">CARROLL PRISON (DUFF GREEN&#8217;S ROW)</p>

<p>The interior of the building was completely renovated
and reconstructed, and here both Houses sat for
a number of years. Within its walls two Presidents
were inaugurated, and here some of our most distinguished
statesmen began their careers. It was in
this building the Hon. John C. Calhoun died.</p>

<p>When it was abandoned by Congress upon the
completion of the Capitol, it was called the &#8220;Old
Capitol,&#8221; as a distinctive title. After that it underwent
a number of changes as boarding-house, school,
etc., until, in 1861, it was taken by the Washington
authorities to be used as a prison.</p>

<p>A row of houses on the adjoining block, known as
Duff Green&#8217;s Row, was afterward taken and used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
as an annex to the Old Capitol, and for the same purpose.
It was called the &#8220;Carroll Prison.&#8221;</p>

<p>On arriving at the Old Capitol, we were halted at
the entrance by the sentry patroling the pavement in
front of the prison door, who called out with a loud
voice, &#8220;Corporal of the guard; Post No. 1.&#8221; This
brought out the corporal, with his musket at his
shoulder, and he escorted us inside.</p>

<p>Entering the prison from First Street, we passed
through a broad hallway, which was used as a guard
room, and thence into a room where prisoners were
first taken to be questioned and searched. I found the
lieutenant in charge more courteous than any of those
in whose custody I had been. After receiving my commitment
from the guard who brought me from the
Provost-Marshal&#8217;s office, he inquired if I had any
arms or other prohibited goods in my possession. I
replied that the only article I had which might come
within the forbidden class was a small pocket-knife,
which I took from my pocket and handed him. He
smiled as he gave it back, and made no further search.
He asked me if I had been to supper, and receiving a
negative reply, led me to a dirty, dismal room, which
I afterward learned was the mess-room. Here,
grouped around a big stove was a gang of negroes,
one of whom, at the lieutenant&#8217;s command, brought
out a chunk of beef, a slice of bread over an inch
thick, and a cup of coffee (?), sweetened, but without
milk. This was set out on a table, of what material
constructed it was impossible to determine on account
of the accumulation of dirt. The meat was served in
a tin plate which looked as though it might have been
through the Peninsular campaign.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>Though I failed, no doubt, to do full justice to the
repast set before me by the good-natured lieutenant,
I certainly appreciated his good intentions and his
honest efforts to entertain me with the best at his
command.</p>

<p>The lieutenant sat and talked with me for some
time before taking me to my room. He asked me if
I would take the oath of allegiance to the Government.
I told him I would not. He asked if I would
be willing to take an oath to support the Constitution
of the United States. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said I, &#8220;but not an
oath to support the Government or Administration.&#8221;
He asked if I were living in a Northern city and came
to Washington and went into business, would I in
that case take the oath. I told him I would not. I
said, &#8220;If I were in the South, even, and that iron-clad
oath&#8221; (as it was called) &#8220;was offered to me, I would
not take it.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>He then accompanied me upstairs to Room No. 16,
and here, after the door was unlocked, I was ushered
into my future quarters. I was welcomed and introduced
by one of my fellow-prisoners to the others of
the party, some of whom had been brought in that
same day.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_024.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">WINDOW IN ROOM 16</p>

<p>Room No. 16 was a spacious room, with one very
large arch window opposite the door from which the
room was entered. This window was directly over the
main entrance to the building on First Street, and in
by-gone days it lighted up the former Senate Chamber.
In the middle of the room a huge cylinder stove
formed the centerpiece, while around and against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
walls were twenty-one bunks or berths, arranged in
three tiers, one above the other. There were a couple
of pine tables, each about five feet long, with a miscellaneous
collection of chairs, benches and home-made
apologies for seats.</p>

<p>When the building was used as the Capitol, this
floor contained the Senate and House of Representatives,
but after its abandonment by Congress the floor
was cut up into five rooms, now numbered from 14
to 18&mdash;No. 16 being the largest. The doors of all
opened into a large hall, from which a broad stairway
led to the floor below.</p>

<p>After spending a couple of hours in swapping stories
and getting better acquainted, the whole party adjourned
to their up-and-downy beds.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, February 1, 1863.</i>&mdash;My first night in my
new quarters was a very uncomfortable one. An old
blanket spread over the hard boards, with a piece of
wood morticed in at the head for a pillow, was the
bed on which I was expected to sleep. All night the
steady tramp of the sentry up and down the hall outside
of our room door, with the clanking of arms, the
challenging of the guards and the calls of the relief
through the night, kept me awake, until at last tired
nature gave way and the god of sleep closed my weary
eyes. How long I slept I know not, but when I woke
it was as if awaking from a troubled dream. I looked
around at my surroundings and then lay down again
on my bunk, pondering on the events of the past night.
After a while I got up and took a wash. There was
but little time required for dressing. Soon the door
was thrown open and there was a call to breakfast.
Being totally unacquainted with the daily routine, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
mechanically followed the crowd, without knowing
where it would lead me. It led me to the mess-room.
It might have led me to a worse place, but it would
have been difficult to find.</p>

<p>It was a long, dirty, gloomy-looking room, with
nothing in its appearance to tempt the appetite, and
the food looked as though served at second-hand. The
odor which assailed the nostrils seemed as if coming
from an ancient garbage heap. The waiter stood at
the head of the long board table, with a handful of
tin cups filled with a liquid by courtesy called coffee.
He would, with a dextrous twist of the wrist, send them
spinning along down the table, leaving each man to
catch one of the flying cups before it slid past. Fortunately,
the waiter had by practice acquired sufficient
skill to enable him to shoot a cup in your direction
without spilling more than one-half of its contents.
With this was served a chunk of beef and a slice of
bread. The beef was left untouched by those who had
the privilege and the means of providing their own
food, but the bread was good, and a generous slice.
I saw my companions slipping their quota of bread
under the breasts of their coats, and I did the same.</p>

<p>After a half-hour&#8217;s recreation in the prison yard, we
went back to our rooms and were locked in. In our
room a table was spread and we had breakfast of ham,
sausage, bread, butter and tea.</p>

<p>Room No. 16 faces the east front of the Capitol,
and by standing or sitting back a short distance from
the window we can look out and see the passers-by.
No persons, however, are allowed to show any signs
of recognition. If a person is seen loitering in passing
the prison, or walking at a pace not considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
satisfactory by the guard, he soon receives a peremptory
command to &#8220;pass on,&#8221; or, &#8220;Hurry up, there,&#8221;
and if this warning is not heeded the offending person,
whether male or female, is arrested and detained.</p>

<p>This morning, two gentlemen walking down on the
opposite side of the street, looked across and smiled.
One of my room-mates raised his hat and bowed.
One of the gentlemen did the same. Immediately we
heard the sentry under the window call out: &#8220;Corporal
of the guard, Post No. 1,&#8221; and an officer coming
out, the person was pointed out, with the remark,
&#8220;That man bowed over here.&#8221; A guard was instantly
dispatched after him, and he was brought over, but
was released in a short time.</p>

<p>Dinner to-day consisted of boiled beans and rusty-looking
fat pork, with molasses (the molasses thin as
water), served up in a dirty tin plate. There being
neither knife, fork nor spoon given out with it, the
only way the mixture could be eaten was by dipping
it up with the bread and thus conveying it to the
mouth.</p>

<p>When we went back to our room we prepared dinner
from our own supply of provisions.</p>

<p>This afternoon three young ladies passing the prison
looked over very pleasantly at the prisoners, who were
in sight at the window, much to the displeasure of the
guard, who stopped his walk and stood watching
them. Finally, one of them smiled and nodded her
head. At this moment came the call&mdash;&#8220;Corporal of
the guard, Post No. 1.&#8221; The young ladies had by this
time reached the corner of the street. Turning
around and seeing the soldier coming after them, they
waved their handkerchiefs and ran down the street.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
The sentry, after picking his way through the mud
across the street, turned back and gave up the chase.</p>

<p>For supper we had a piece of bread, without butter,
and a cup of coffee (?), without milk.</p>

<p>The bill of fare here given for the three meals of
this day would serve, with but little variation, for the
entire time of my detention.</p>

<p>One of the prisoners, a Confederate soldier, whom
I met in the yard to-day, told me that he was just
recovering from a fever, and although he had an
excellent appetite, his stomach was weak and he could
not eat the food set before him; that as he had no
money to purchase anything else, he was compelled to
go hungry.</p>

<p>With the exception of the bread, which is good
(thanks to Superintendent Wood), the food dealt out
here is poor in quality and insufficient in quantity.
I noticed some of the boxes were marked &#8220;White
House,&#8221; from which I inferred the contents were condemned
army stores.</p>

<p>Those who can afford to do so club together and,
having obtained permission, purchase such articles as
the sutler will procure for them. The goods kept in
stock by this dignitary are neither very choice nor
varied, chiefly tobacco, cigars, cakes, candy, pies, etc.
For our mess in Room 16, we select one man as treasurer,
and he purchases our supplies, such as coffee,
tea, sugar, cheese, and he occasionally has a large ham
boiled. All of these articles the sutler furnishes at
prices far beyond their market value; but we are glad
to get them, and compelled from necessity to submit
to the extortion.</p>

<p>Prisoners having money or friends outside of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
prison can obtain many necessaries and enjoy comforts
which are denied those less fortunate. A friend (Mrs.
Ennis), living near the prison, sends dinner in to me
every day. There is always enough to feed three or
four abundantly, and none of it is ever wasted.</p>

<p>We take turns in the household work&mdash;cooking and
cleaning up&mdash;two men being detailed for this duty
each day. It is unnecessary to say our cooking arrangements
are very simple.</p>

<p>In our room there are two, one, I think, a Yankee
deserter, known as &#8220;Dutchy&#8221; and &#8220;Slim Jim,&#8221; who
are unable to contribute their quota to the commissary
fund, but as they can make a pot of coffee or tea, and
wield a broom or wash a dirty dish, they are always
ready to make up their deficit by taking the place of
room-mates afflicted with hook-worm or victims of
inertia.</p>

<p>Having our meals in our own room, we can take
the whole half-hour allowed at meal time for recreation
in the prison yard, which gives us an opportunity
to mingle with prisoners from other rooms than our
own. This meeting of old friends and comrades, and
the making of new acquaintances, is a source of great
pleasure to us and a relief from the monotony of what
would otherwise be the dull routine of prison life.</p>

<p><i>Monday, Feb. 2.</i>&mdash;To-night two men were brought
into our room. They say they were employed in General
Halleck&#8217;s office, and are confined here for absenting
themselves without leave. They are looked upon
with suspicion by our party, who fear they may be
spies.</p>

<p>Persons are often put in the rooms with prisoners,
who, while posing as prisoners themselves, are really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
spies or detectives in the employ of the officials. They
associate with the prisoners in their rooms, and also
in the yard during the time allowed for recreation,
and by assuming an air of injured innocence as victims
of oppression, seek to gain their confidence with
the intention of betraying them. If they can succeed
in overcoming their suspicions and induce the prisoners
to speak freely, these detectives report the conversations
to their employers.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, Feb. 4.</i>&mdash;Superintendent Wood said
last night that he would allow the party in Room
16 (as they were not satisfied with the prison fare),
if they preferred it, to receive the money in lieu of
rations, and supply themselves. This was agreed to.</p>

<p>Mr. James Fullerton came to see me to-day. An
official seated himself directly in front of us during
the interview, and when Mr. Fullerton proceeded to
ask me if I had any idea as to the person who had me
arrested, the official interrupted him, saying he would
be allowed to speak only of family affairs. Mr. Fullerton
said he only wished to find out something of the
nature of the charges against me, in order to furnish
rebutting testimony. He was twice interrupted while
attempting to ask me questions.</p>

<p>I had written a note to my wife, asking her to send
me a change of clothing and some articles necessary
here, for even with frequent changes it is difficult to
keep free from vermin. To-day I asked Mr. Drew,
the clerk, if it had been sent. He said, &#8220;Why, you
have sent her all the word you wanted to send.&#8221; I
said, &#8220;I have sent nothing but the note which you still
retain.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, then,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I will send that. I
thought you had written before.&#8221; Had I not called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
his attention to this note it would not have been
delivered.</p>

<p>This was the first and last letter I sent out during
my term of imprisonment, as I found all letters had to
go first to the Provost-Marshal&#8217;s office for inspection,
and then it was doubtful when they would reach
their destination, if at all. A young man named Hurst
wrote a letter to his father, who was residing in
Washington City, and nine days passed before it was
delivered.</p>

<p>A young man named Moore died to-night in one of
the adjoining rooms. He was arrested without any
specific charge. Though he was very ill at the time,
he was marched eight miles. This proved too great
a strain for him, and he died soon after his arrival
here. His poor old mother was with him at the time
of his death. Knowing his condition, and fearing he
would not survive the effects of the long journey, she
followed after. She was greatly excited. Throwing
up her hands, she exclaimed: &#8220;I have lost all. I am
ruined. My poor boy was all that was left to me,
and now you have robbed me of him. But if there is
a just God He will not suffer my wrongs to go
unpunished.&#8221;</p>

<p>Towering up in front of our window rises the stately
dome of the Capitol, its top being prepared for the
statue of &#8220;Freedom.&#8221; What a contrast! What a
spectacle from a prison window!</p>

<p>Some newspapers received to-night contain rumors
from Charleston of the raising of the blockade, and
also accounts of some dashing exploits of Wheeler&#8217;s
Cavalry, consequently there is great rejoicing among
the Confederate prisoners, who can scarcely contain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
themselves. The news soon spread, and cheers were
given in every room where they are confined. The
officers on duty were very lenient, and went around
endeavoring to quiet the prisoners, saying the noise
sounded badly in the street, and had a damaging
effect. Some of the guards, however, were in a very
ugly mood, and as one of our men went from the
room to get water, one of the soldiers on guard made
a wicked thrust at him with his bayonet.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, Feb. 5.</i>&mdash;Snowing hard this morning and
continuing until evening, when it turned to rain.</p>

<p>Received parcel to-day from home, containing
clothing, etc.</p>

<p>Every day from eight to twelve wagons pass the
prison, laden with dead horses and mules, from the
camps around Washington. From this alone one can
form an idea of the number of animals used up by
the army.</p>

<p><i>Friday, Feb. 6.</i>&mdash;Colonel Doster, Provost-Marshal,
paid a visit to the prison to-night. He came into our
room. On being asked by Mr. Hunter concerning his
case, he said: &#8220;Gentlemen, your cases have all been
decided by military governors.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Feb. 8.</i>&mdash;A great many ladies and gentlemen
pass and repass the prison, many merely from
curiosity, perhaps, and the guards are very vigilant to
see that they exchange no signals or glances with prisoners.
This afternoon two ladies bowed to our window,
and a corporal was sent after them. He followed
them about half a block, and we could see him
talking to them for some little time, but he came back
without them.</p>

<p>A little later, two old gentlemen stopped on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
street opposite the prison. One of them took from his
pocket a small spy-glass, which he applied to his eye
and took a careful survey of the building, to the great
discomfort of the sentry, who called to him several
times to pass on. The old gentleman paid no attention
to the call, and the sentry asked the officer if he
should arrest him. The old man then coolly put up
his glass, waved his hand and passed on.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_033.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">COLONEL WILLIAM P. WOOD, SUPERINTENDENT</p>

<p>To-day being Sunday, the superintendent, Mr.
Wood,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> went through the prison, making the announcement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
at each door, that all who wished to hear
the Gospel according to Jeff Davis could go down to
the yard, where a Secesh preacher would give it to
them (this was the Rev. Mr. Landstreet, a Confederate
chaplain, who is imprisoned here), and all who wanted
to hear the Lord God according to Abe Lincoln could
be accommodated in Room 16.</p>

<p>Mr. Wood professes to be an infidel, and therefore,
while his partisan feelings are very strong on the question
of duty and devotion to the Union cause, he is
not disposed to view it from a Gospel standpoint. I
have heard, however, that he was born and baptized
in the Catholic Church, but left it, and in the days of
Know-Nothingism became a prominent leader in that
party. I went down to the yard, not so much to hear
the reverend preacher (though my preference, if any,
would have led me to select him) as to enjoy a smoke
and a social chat with some of my friends from the
other rooms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span><i>Monday, Feb. 9.</i>&mdash;The Tenth New Jersey Regiment
is the prison guard here. Among them are many who
combine the qualities of soldier and gentleman, but
there are some who lack both. The latter, I am glad
to say, are in the minority.</p>

<p>Last night before going to our bunks, we were
shaking the coal stove. The grate was choked and it
was hard to rake out. A guard was sent up to the room,
and one said gruffly:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is all this noise about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are raking the stove,&#8221; said one of our party.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you are not,&#8221; replied the fellow; &#8220;I know
what you are doing&mdash;you are dancing, and if I hear
any more of it, some of you will get in the guard
house.&#8221; Being prisoners, we have to submit to this
insolence.</p>

<p>This morning, as I was standing at the window
looking out, I heard the sentinel on the sidewalk under
the window order a prisoner in the next room to go
from the window, or he would get a ball through him.
I was standing about a foot back from the bars when
the sentry, an ill-looking fellow, called out to me:</p>

<p>&#8220;Get away from that window.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not touching the bars,&#8221; said I. I had been
told by prisoners long confined in the Old Capitol that
a prisoner was permitted to look out of the window so
long as he did not touch the bars.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will put a ball through you, damn you,&#8221; said the
brute, at the same time cocking his gun and aiming at
me. As I thought the cowardly rascal might shoot,
and I would only be exposing myself foolishly, I drew
back.</p>

<p>When I related this affair to a fellow-prisoner, Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
Augustus Williams, he told me that he was a prisoner
in the Old Capitol at the time young Wharton was
shot, and his room was on the same floor.</p>

<p>It was either in the latter part of March or first of
April, 1862, that Jesse W. Wharton, a young man
about twenty-five or twenty-six years of age, son of
Professor Wharton, of Prince George County, Md.,
was deliberately murdered by a man belonging to the
91st Pennsylvania Regiment, then on guard duty at
the prison. Wharton was standing at the window of
his room when the sentry called out to him: &#8220;Get away
from that window, or I will blow your damned head
off.&#8221; Wharton turned away, walked across the room
and again stood at the window as before. The guard,
on seeing him, repeated his command, or words to the
same effect. Wharton, feeling that as he was violating
no rule the guard would not attempt to carry out his
threat, paid no further attention, but stood with his
arms folded. The sentry (I cannot call him soldier)
fired, and the ball struck Wharton in the left hand,
passed through the right arm, breaking the bone of
the elbow, entered the right side, coming out near the
spine. He staggered, and would have fallen, but some
of his fellow-prisoners caught him and lowered him
gently to the floor. He lingered for seven or eight
hours. Before he died he called for the lieutenant
commanding the post, and when he came in, the dying
man said: &#8220;I am dying, and you are the man who
caused my death.&#8221; He said he heard the lieutenant
give the man the order to fire.</p>

<p>Williams also mentioned another case, that of Harry
Stewart, son of Dr. Frederick Stewart, of Baltimore,
a young man less than twenty-five years of age. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
had been to Richmond, and on his return was arrested
as a spy and sent to the Old Capitol. One of the
sentinels, a member of the 86th Regiment New York
Volunteers, agreed for a bribe of fifty dollars to allow
him to escape by lowering himself from the window
to the pavement below. Stewart waited until the hour
appointed, when this particular sentry should be on
guard. He then let himself out of the window and was
lowered but a few feet when the sentry cried, &#8220;Halt!&#8221;
and fired, the ball striking Stewart&#8217;s right leg, splintering
the knee-bone. He was quickly drawn up by
his room-mates, and the prison surgeon amputated
the limb. The shock was too great, however, and he
died in a short time after the operation. The money
(fifty dollars) was found in his pocket, wrapped up in
paper, upon which was written, &#8220;This is the money I
promised you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Augustus Williams, to whom I am indebted for these
facts, is a citizen of Fairfax County, Virginia. Living
near Vienna, and being within the Union lines, he was
arrested and taken to the Old Capitol. There being
no charge against him, except refusal to take the oath,
he was released after a short term of imprisonment.
Going back to his home, he was again picked up by
the first party of troops raiding in his neighborhood,
and returned to the Old Capitol. This occurred so
frequently that Superintendent Wood came to look
upon him as a regular visitor, and would greet him
on his arrival with a handshake, and say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Gus; you&#8217;re back again. You couldn&#8217;t stay
away from us very long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he would reply. &#8220;You fellows treat me so
well when I am here. And then, it&#8217;s such a nice trip to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
go back home by way of Fortress Monroe and
Richmond.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some of the prisoners who have gone out recently
are suspected of having purchased their freedom at a
cash valuation.</p>

<p>A man named George Hammett was brought in on
Saturday night with a number of prisoners. He was
captured on the Potomac River, and is charged with
attempting to run the blockade. He was called down
from the room this morning, and on his return said
that he told Superintendent Wood he was willing to
take the oath. Wood told him that hereafter no one
would be released on simply taking the oath; that he
might be released on payment of a sum of money&mdash;from
one to six hundred dollars. These blockade
runners, I suppose, are thought to have money, and
this, no doubt, is but a plan to extort money from
them.</p>

<p>Emanuel Weiler was released to-day. He was taken
with Aaron J. King on charge of carrying contraband
goods.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, Feb. 10.</i>&mdash;This morning two ladies passing
the building bowed to prisoners at our window. A
guard was sent out and brought them in. They were
released after fifteen or twenty minutes&#8217; detention,
Brave soldiers! How fortunate the weather continues
cool so that the ladies cannot <i>bare</i> arms, as it might
interfere with the prison arrangements, making it
necessary to double the guard in order to insure the
safe keeping of the prisoners and protect our timorous
guards.</p>

<p>After dinner a guard came into the room and escorted
me down before Captain Parker, who told me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
to take a seat, while he proceeded to look over a paper
he held in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you from?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have resided in this city for the past seven or
eight years,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where were you born?&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_039.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>James Williamson</i><br />

From picture taken in 1861</p>

<p>&#8220;I was born in Baltimore and lived there until I
came to Washington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your occupation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Printer; but since November I have been engaged
in a bookstore on Seventh Street.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been South during the war?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What were you doing there?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>&#8220;I was employed at Ritchie &amp; Dunnavant&#8217;s.&#8221;
(Ritchie &amp; Dunnavant did the printing for the State
and Confederate governments).</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know Henry Howe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever have any difficulty with him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did. Mr. Howe and a man named Daniels came
to Richmond while I was there. They took board at
a house kept by Mrs. Graves, on Franklin Street,
where I was boarding. On the night of July 3d or
4th, I had a sum of money stolen from my pockets.
Mr. Howe and his friend slept in the room adjoining
mine. The door between the rooms was left open,
while the doors leading from the rooms into the hall
were locked. The pants, in the pockets of which I had
the money, were hung on a hook near the door, and
in the morning the money was gone. Mr. Howe had
been boarding in the house for about five weeks without
paying any board. That morning he and his friend
Daniels left and went to another boarding-house. Before
leaving, Howe told Mrs. Graves he would not take his
baggage away until he paid her all he owed. He put
his clothes in Daniels&#8217; trunk, and they left with one
trunk. The next day Daniels came to me and said:
&#8216;Howe has stolen your money. You know, he had
none before he left, and now he has plenty, and he is
lying in a beer house on Main Street, drunk.&#8217; I took
Daniels to a detective, to whom he repeated this story.
The detective arrested Howe. He was kept in prison
for about a week. When brought before the Mayor
of Richmond (Joseph Mayo) for final examination, the
Mayor said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I am confident one of you two men took that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
money, but as there are two of you, it is possible one
may be innocent, therefore I am obliged to release
you both. But I will give you twenty-four hours to
leave the city, and if you do not leave within that
time I will have you arrested under this act (reading
them the vagrant act) and put to work in the
chain-gang.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever taken an oath of allegiance to the
South?&#8221; asked Captain Parker.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you take an oath to this government?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir; I would not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is very strange. That you will not take an
oath to support a government under whose flag you
live and which protects you. And you born in Maryland,
a loyal State, as she has proved to be by the
vote of her people.&#8221;</p>

<p>As I was a prisoner in his hands, I knew it would
be folly on my part to enter into an argument on this
question, but I said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not take an oath of allegiance. You take
an oath of office which is binding on you so long as
you hold office, but you ask me to take an oath of
perpetual allegiance&mdash;&#8216;<i>at any and all times hereafter,
and under all circumstances</i>.&#8217; You have shown no act
of mine to prove me disloyal, and I think you have no
right to demand such oath.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your refusal to take the oath is sufficient proof
of your disloyalty. How long have you been here,
sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A week last Saturday. I was arrested and brought
here, and have not been able to learn either the name
of my accuser or the nature of the accusation.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>&#8220;I will inform you, then, that Mr. Howe is the principal
witness against you. I have done with you for
to-day, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>I then left him and went back to my room. Here
one man is judge, jury and witness.</p>

<p>There are a number of men here in close confinement.
We can see them as they are taken out in the
yard daily in charge of a guard. None of the other
prisoners are allowed to speak to them.</p>

<p>I have been fascinated with the reading of Byron&#8217;s
&#8220;Prisoner of Chillon&#8221; and with Dumas&#8217; picture
of the &#8220;Man With the Iron Mask,&#8221; of the
mysteries and miseries of the Bastile, and the
wretched prisoners who were immured within
its dismal walls. I have felt my blood tingle
when I read of men who had not been convicted
of any crime, and, in some instances, who had committed
no crime, yet had been confined for years&mdash;often
uncared for and forgotten, under the infamous
system of the <i>lettre de cachet</i>. I regarded them mostly
as sensational stories&mdash;as fiction&mdash;but here the picture
is faithfully copied&mdash;the <i>lettre de cachet</i>, the prison,
the murder&mdash;all here in the stern reality.</p>

<p>Many persons confined here were arrested, robbed
of everything they possessed, and kept merely on suspicion
for weeks, and even months, without examination
or trial, and sometimes, after an examination and
no proof of charges, being still detained.</p>

<p>The occupants of the rooms on the same floor with
Room 16 (Rooms 14, 15 and 18), are mostly farmers
from Virginia, living either within the Union lines
or on disputed territory. Because of their refusal to
take the oath of allegiance, they are arrested and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
brought to the Old Capitol. They were robbed of
their personal property, their negroes run off, and
in many instances their houses and farm buildings
destroyed.</p>

<p>Among the prisoners with me in Room 16 is an old
gentleman named Henry Love. He and his son
Llewellyn are both prisoners. The old gentleman
seems completely broken down. In telling me the story
of his treatment, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I kept a hotel, and also farmed, near Dumfries,
Virginia. I had a farm of 200 acres, all under cultivation,
except about 25 acres in wood. My house was
taken by Federal troops and used as a hospital, leaving
me only three rooms for myself and family. They
killed seventeen head of cattle, some of the finest cows
you ever saw; my stock was all choice breeds. One
cow, with her second calf, was killed, her hindquarters
cut off, and the balance, with the calf, left to rot.
They killed forty hogs, took two of my best horses,
Black Hawks, killed all my poultry; took two stacks
of hay, two entire crops of corn, wheat and oats, and
two hundred and seventy pounds of bacon. They destroyed
all my shrubbery and fences. My place is now
as bare as the palm of your hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was afterward taken prisoner, then released on
parole, but is now again under arrest. He was called
before Parker, who told him there were no charges
against him, but as he was a Secessionist he would
have to keep him for a while.</p>

<p>Another is James Johnson, of Clarke County, Virginia,
who was taken from his home by a raiding
party. He was robbed of everything, his horse stolen,
and he has been kept a prisoner for two months. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
is sick all the time; appears to be in an advanced stage
of consumption.</p>

<p>Mr. Redmond Brawner, who lived at Manassas, lost
everything, and he, with his family, were compelled to
become refugees. He was arrested, and is now a
prisoner here.</p>

<p>Mr. James F. Kerfoot, of Millwood, Clarke County,
Virginia, when arrested was buying cattle for the
Confederate Government. He had in his possession
$18,000 belonging to the Government and $400 of his
own money. He was stripped of everything.</p>

<p>Another of my room-mates is Mr. George S. Ayre,
of Loudoun County, Virginia. At the outbreak of
the war he was a wealthy farmer and cattle dealer. He
owned one of the finest improved farms in the county
and slaves enough to cultivate it. The army under
General Geary camped in the neighborhood of his
farm, and one day loaded up twenty-six four-horse
wagons with corn and provender, and in return the
quartermaster gave receipts. Since then he has suffered
at the hands of raiding parties, and now is
arrested and imprisoned here.</p>

<p>[Mr. Ayre was released a short time before I was
and returned to his home. In the Fall of 1863, General
Hunter threatened Lynchburg, where Mr. Ayre
had a quantity of tobacco stored. Fearing it might be
destroyed, he went South, disposed of it, and started
for home with the proceeds of the sale. When near
James City, in Culpeper County, he met a scouting
party from Meade&#8217;s army, who first carried him to
headquarters and then to Washington, where the
Provost-Marshal took from him his money, amounting
to $80,000 in Virginia money, a $1,000 bond, and some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
valuable papers, and held him as a hostage for a
Captain Samuel Steers, who was captured by Mosby&#8217;s
men. He was held a prisoner for nine months.</p>

<p>His slaves all remained with him, and he continued
to cultivate his land, consequently he had good crops
on hand in November, 1864, when General Sheridan
sent his forces into Loudoun to destroy crops and
property in his futile efforts to drive out Mosby and
his men, who continued to occupy the same ground
until after the surrender of General Lee. Mr. Ayre
then had three crops of wheat in the stack. The Union
troops burned 8,000 bushels of wheat, 130 tons of hay,
70 acres of corn in the shock, a new barn with all his
machinery and farming implements, and drove off 80
fine improved sheep.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>After the war he put in a claim, through his Representative
in Congress, endeavoring to recover something
for these losses, but his claim was bandied about
from committee to committee, and from Congress to
the Court of Claims, while the poor old man, now in
his 93d year, penniless and broken in health, is unable
to get a cent from the Government in return.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span><i>Wednesday, Feb. 11.</i>&mdash;We received some newspapers
to-day, and in them I see it stated that Captain Wynne
escaped from the Old Capitol Prison on Monday night
last, by breaking out a panel of his door. This no
doubt gave rise to the ghost story which was going
the rounds of the prison at that time, of the ghost
without a head who frightened the wits out of some of
the sentries.</p>

<p>I heard a great commotion in the prison to-day, and
as the noise approached nearer and grew more distinct,
I could detect the cry of &#8220;Fresh fish! Fresh fish!&#8221;
which I was afterward told announced the arrival of a
fresh lot of prisoners. Among them were a number of
blockade runners&mdash;eleven white and six negroes. Two
of the whites were put in our room. At the advent of
a new prisoner, the old ones gather around, anxious
to hear the latest news from the outside world.</p>

<p>Captain Thomas Phillips had an interview with
Captain Parker to-day. He was sentenced to three
months&#8217; imprisonment.</p>

<p>Phillips was captain of a vessel captured while attempting
to run the blockade into Wilmington, N. C.
His clothes and money, together with his quadrant
and charts, were all taken from him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>Blockade running is a dangerous but, when successful,
a very profitable business. Of the few ports of
the Southern Confederacy used for running the blockade,
that of Wilmington, N. C., is the one most frequently
chosen, from the fact of there being two
entrances, or channels, leading into the Cape Fear
River, on which the city of Wilmington is situated,
the south entrance being protected by Fort Fisher and
Fort Caswell; the north, or new inlet, by Fort Fisher
and a small land battery.</p>

<p>[One of the strongest inducements for running the
blockade was the enormous value of cotton outside of
the Confederacy. A vessel laden with provisions,
medical stores, arms and munitions of war for the
Confederate Government, effecting an entrance, discharging
her load and taking in a return cargo of cotton,
which would perhaps yield a profit of five or six
hundred per cent., if successful in evading the blockading
squadron, would certainly furnish a strong
incentive for other daring adventurers to take the risk
of a voyage.</p>

<p>The high rate of wages paid to master and crew
was always a sufficient inducement to secure a complement
of hardy and efficient men for the enterprise.]</p>

<p>Three ladies called at the prison to-day. After they
left the building, one of them looked up, and seeing
some of the prisoners at the window, bowed to them.
The guard called out to the corporal, who started a
soldier after them. He pursued them down the street,
but returned shortly after, saying they refused to return
with him. Of course, we were all pleased with the
result.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, Feb. 12.</i>&mdash;Our time is spent in reading,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
when we have anything to read; card playing, dominoes,
or checkers. Newspapers we get occasionally.
Some devote much of their time to smoking, others
to relating stories of adventures, with an occasional
song and dance.</p>

<p>Among the songs is one, written before my advent
into this, my prison home, by some one, of whose name
even I am ignorant; but being a picture of our prison
life, as well as a faithful expression of the sentiments
cherished at the time in the breasts of many who
dared not give them utterance outside of these
prison walls, without the risk of punishment or exile,
I give it here entire and unaltered.</p>

<p>This would be one feature of the program, with
&#8220;Maryland, My Maryland,&#8221; &#8220;Dixie,&#8221; &#8220;The Bonnie
Blue Flag,&#8221; and a song, the chorus of which ran&mdash;&#8220;Ain&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
You Glad You&#8217;re Out of the Wilderness?&#8221; but
which a few months later was changed to &#8220;Ol&#8217; Joe
Hooker, Come Out of the Wilderness.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the singing would lag a little, Fax Minor,
on whom the sound of music or singing caused a contraction
and extension of the muscles, producing an
effect like pulling the strings of a supple-jack, would
jump up and execute a regular plantation break-down.</p>

<p>Some of our room-mates were gifted with good
voices, which, though untrained or uncultivated, were
pleasing to the ear, and, combined with the sentiment
of the songs, had an inspiring effect on the listeners,
like the strains of martial music on the lagging footsteps
of the marching soldier.</p>

<p>One day as they were singing &#8220;Maryland, My
Maryland,&#8221; Gus Williams, getting up from a bench
near the stove, where he sat whittling a stick, advanced
toward the group of singers and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You boys sing that well, but I&#8217;ve heard &#8216;My
Maryland&#8217; sung here in the old building in a way
that would make you feel like jumping out of the
window and swimming across the Potomac. When
Belle Boyd was here I was on the same floor. She
would sing that song as if her very soul was in every
word she uttered. It used to bring a lump up in my
throat every time I heard it. It seemed like my heart
was ready to jump out&mdash;as if I could put my finger
down and touch it. I&#8217;ve seen men, when she was singing,
walk off to one side and pull out their handkerchiefs
and wipe their eyes, for fear some one would
see them doing the baby act.</p>

<p>&#8220;She left soon after I came in. I was glad to know
that she was released, but we all missed her. Even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
some of the Yankees, although they would not show
it while she was here; but when she was sent away
they missed her sweet singing&mdash;Rebel songs though
they were. One of them told me it made him feel
sad to hear her sing.</p>

<p>&#8220;And on Sundays, when there was preaching down
in the yard, she would be allowed to come down and
sit near the preacher. If you could only have seen
how the fellows would try to get near her as she
passed. And if she gave them a look or a smile, it
did them more good than the preaching. You wouldn&#8217;t
hear a cuss word from any of them for a week, even
if one of the guards would swear at them or threaten
them.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span><i>Friday, Feb. 13.</i>&mdash;George Hammett, Davis, Gardner
and George were released this afternoon upon taking
the oath.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, Feb. 14.</i>&mdash;A number of prisoners were
brought in to-day. There are said to be 450 prisoners
here at present, the greater portion of them being
citizens.</p>

<p>Last night I was awakened by hearing an unusual
commotion throughout the building. This morning
there were a number of prisoners in the guard house.
It is said that Captain Darling and George Adreon
escaped. The sentinel was bribed, and a greater number
would have escaped but for the indiscretion of the
prisoners. They were so jubilant at the prospect of
getting out, that they had some whiskey sneaked into
the room and treated the sentinel. They made him
drunk, so that he had to be taken off post, and he was
put in the guard house. The new man being ignorant
of the deal made with his comrade, the whole scheme
failed. There is a standing order to sentinels on each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
floor to allow not more than two men to leave their
rooms at a time. Trusting to their arrangement with
the sentry, the prisoners who were in the plot would
leave singly on this night, at slight intervals, until the
guards, seeing so many more going out than the rules
permitted, became suspicious and reported their suspicions.
Consequently, as each prisoner left his room
and went down stairs, he was quietly taken to the
guard house, until the number of absentees from the
rooms became so numerous the prisoners themselves
grew suspicious, and the exodus was stopped.</p>

<p>It is an easy matter to get whiskey here. A bright
young contraband, whose ebony face gives proof of
the purity of his Congo blood, comes into our room
every morning to remove the ashes and refuse. For a
trifling sum Charlie will bring in two flasks of whiskey
in the breast pockets of his coat, and afterward take
back the empty flasks. Many of the prison guards are
ready to do the same when asked.</p>

<p>Mr. James Fullerton came to see me to-day. He
told me my wife went to the Provost-Marshal&#8217;s office
last Tuesday and asked for a pass to visit me, but was
refused.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Feb. 15.</i>&mdash;Stephen R. Mount, of Loudoun
County, Virginia, aged sixty-eight, was put in our
room to-day. There is another old gentleman here,
named Randolph, aged seventy-five. He is also from
Virginia.</p>

<p>An order was issued to-day that no more singing of
Rebel songs will be tolerated. Also, that any prisoner
bowing or otherwise noticing persons passing on the
street, will be put in the guard house.</p>

<p>There are no printed rules for our guidance placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
where they can be seen, and no official instructions as
to how we are to act, or to whom we shall make known
our necessities. A knowledge can only be gained from
conversing with prisoners who have been a long time
in the prison, or from actual observation, or from seeing
punishment inflicted upon some poor wretch for a
violation of an unwritten law. One can only do as
you see others do, and if you blindly follow a willful
or ignorant transgressor, you must take the punishment
of a guilty person.</p>

<p>The daily routine may be summed up as follows:</p>

<p>The first call in the morning is when the door is
thrown open and breakfast announced. All in the
room then scamper down to the yard and into the
mess-room already described.</p>

<p>About nine o&#8217;clock the door is again opened and a
voice shouts in tones loud enough to be heard by all,
&#8220;Sick Call.&#8221; Then all who have need of medicine
or treatment go to the hospital, located in a two-story
wooden building, an extension of the main building,
and reached by a flight of steps leading up from the
prison yard.</p>

<p>The next sensation is the dinner call. This gives
the prisoners a half-hour, most of which, if not all,
is spent in the yard. The yard is about one hundred
feet square, partly paved with bricks or cobble-stones.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>
On the side of this yard, extending from this wooden
building occupied as sutler&#8217;s shop, mess-room and
hospital, and running back to the gate, is a one-story<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
stone building in which are the cook house, guard
house and wash house. Back of this building are the
sinks used by the prisoners. These are wide trenches
with a long wooden rail in front, after the manner of
the trenches in the camps, except that when those in
the camps become offensive they are filled in with
earth and new ones dug. The presence of these sinks,
used for months by several hundred men, it may be
safely said, did not contribute to the beauty of the
scenery or add sweetness to the tainted air. Any
further description, I think, is better left to the imagination
than expressed in words.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_055.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">STOVE WHICH STOOD IN CENTER OF ROOM 16</p>

<p>After returning to our rooms there is another lull
until supper-time, when we enjoy the freedom of the
prison yard until it is rudely broken into by the gruff
voice of the sergeant: &#8220;Time&#8217;s up. Go to your
rooms.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next comes the roll-call, when the prisoners are
lined up in their respective rooms to answer to their
names as called.</p>

<p>Lastly, taps is sounded, by the guard marching
through the halls and calling out at the doors of the
rooms: &#8220;Lights out.&#8221; At this warning cry every light
must be extinguished, and the prisoners are compelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
to go to their bunks or sit in the dark. And
here is where our rusty fat pork, saved by us from
the mess-room table, is made do good service.</p>

<p>One night we sat around the stove, with a quantity
of this over-rich food, contributed by the inmates of
our room, one of whom sat in front of the stove and
threw in piece by piece as it burned away. This shed
a light over the room, and it was seen by the sentry
pacing his beat in front of the building. He called
out &#8220;Corporal of the guard, Post No. 1.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a few minutes the sound of approaching footsteps
was heard in the hall outside, the door was
thrown open and a corporal with guard entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing with a light here?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have no light here,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have,&#8221; said the corporal, &#8220;we can see it plainly
from the street.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that is only a piece of fat meat we threw in the
stove.&#8221;</p>

<p>The corporal, although he saw the flickering remains
through the open stove door, marched away with an
incredulous and unsatisfied air.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, Feb. 17.</i>&mdash;Captain Parker called me
down this afternoon. He told me he had received a
letter from Mr. James Fullerton, stating that my wife
was ill, and my eldest child very ill with dropsy after
scarlet fever. He said that under the circumstances
he would grant me a parole for one day only, to
see them. I was accordingly released to report to
Superintendent Wood at five o&#8217;clock to-morrow.
On reaching home, I found my son Henry lying
ill, delirious, and so changed I could scarcely recognize
him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span><i>Wednesday, Feb. 18.</i>&mdash;<i>At Home.</i>&mdash;Mrs. Fullerton
called this morning. She said she had been to the prison
and had carried a few things, including my wife&#8217;s
picture. The officer who received them said he would
give them to me. She then handed him a note from
my mother, stating that my wife was recovering from
her illness and was able to go about the house. When
requested to hand me this the officer said: &#8220;There
can be no communication, unless it goes through the
Provost-Marshal&#8217;s office.&#8221; So I had been denied this
slight gratification, of knowing that my wife, whom
I left suffering from an attack of typhus fever, was
improving in health. This afternoon I went to prison
and reported myself to Captain Higgins. I told him
my child was very ill; that the disease was just at its
height and his recovery doubtful. That under the circumstances
I would like to have my parole extended
for a short time, until I saw how the disease would
likely terminate. He told me he would see Captain
Parker. After hearing my request, Parker asked if
I could get a certificate to the effect that my child
was dangerously ill. Told him I could. He said:
&#8220;If you will bring me such certificate from the attending
physician, I will grant you a parole until Friday,
at 5 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>&#8221; He added, &#8220;As you are living in this
city and refuse to take the oath, it proves that your
sympathy is with the South.&#8221; After leaving the prison
I went to the office of Dr. Toner and procured the
required certificate.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, Feb. 19.</i>&mdash;This morning went to
headquarters of Military Governor, and gave
the certificate to Captain Parker, according to agreement.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>From a conversation which I overheard while standing
on the steps at the Provost-Marshal&#8217;s office, one
can get a faint idea of the state of society now existing
under the infamous spy system. A sergeant and
corporal were standing near the doorway, conversing
with a citizen:</p>

<p>Sergeant&mdash;You know he is a Secessionist?</p>

<p>Citizen&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>Sergeant&mdash;Then go in and report him.</p>

<p>Citizen (smiling and shrugging his shoulders)&mdash;I
don&#8217;t like&mdash;</p>

<p>Corporal&mdash;You have gone too far now; you must
go in and report him.</p>

<p>Sergeant&mdash;Your name won&#8217;t appear at all in this.</p>

<p>The citizen still appeared to hesitate, but the two
were still urging him when I passed on.</p>

<p>Fostered by partisan hatred or private malice, a
system of espionage has been established which is felt
on every side. Servants and employees are tampered
with, witnesses are bought or threatened. Actions or
expressions, in themselves perfectly innocent, are perverted
and by misconstruction made to assume an
air of treason or disloyalty. In this way persons are
often arrested and imprisoned for months without
trial or without even knowing the nature of the charge
against them or the name of their accuser.</p>

<p><i>Friday, Feb. 20.</i>&mdash;Henry passed a very uneasy
night. The doctor says he is not so well this morning
as yesterday; still, he says he has hopes of saving
him. I hope for the best, yet fear the worst. This
afternoon, between four and five o&#8217;clock, reported myself
at the Old Capitol. After having my valise
searched, I retired to my room, where I found a number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
of prisoners in addition to those I left when I
went out on parole.</p>

<p>Captain Phillips was released from guard house this
afternoon. A few days ago he asked Wood to give
him a parole. Wood refused, and said no paroles
would be granted. Phillips said a man who was confined
under similar circumstances to himself had been
given a parole on the day his vessel was to be sold.
Soon after this interview I saw Phillips and Wood
running around the yard, both much excited. Phillips
said, &#8220;Come on; I will show you the man.&#8221; Wood
said, &#8220;Go on; I&#8217;ll prove either you or him to be a
liar.&#8221; When Phillips found the man, Wood was not
to be found.</p>

<p>A day or two after this, Phillips was going into the
office to pay the clerk, Mr. Drew, for a pair of spectacles,
when Wood, who was in the office at the time, called
out to him in a rough manner, and Phillips went out
and closed the door. When he got to his room a
guard came up and took him to the guard house, from
which he was only released to-day. Wood said he had
not intended to keep him there so long, but had forgotten
him.</p>

<p>How faithfully does history repeat itself. How
many unfortunates have been arrested, thrown into
prison, and their accusers having accomplished their
object in placing them in durance, cared no more
about them, and their jailers were totally indifferent
in the matter. Wood said the principal cause for his
punishment was the indifference with which Phillips
appeared to treat him.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Feb. 22.</i>&mdash;I was told there are over five
hundred prisoners here now. When those in our room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
were counted last night there were found to be thirty-four.
A number of <i>fresh fish</i> have been brought in
since my return.</p>

<p>Sixty-two prisoners were brought here from Camp
Chase. Some have been imprisoned for fifteen months.
About twenty of them have no charge against them
except refusal to take the oath.</p>

<p>Goldsmith said that while he was in the guard
house a Union soldier was put in who was drunk and
noisy, and the lieutenant came in, slapped him in the
face and kicked him several times.</p>

<p>One of my fellow-prisoners is an old gentleman
from Virginia, named John B. Hunter. He is over
sixty years of age. He is detained without any charge
whatever, but as a hostage for a man named Stiles,
who has made himself notorious as a spy and detective,
and by acting as guide in piloting raiding parties
through Virginia. Mr. Hunter was called down last
night by Captain Parker, who told him information
had been received that Stiles had been released, and
that he, too, would be released. That he could leave
the prison then or wait until to-day. He has been in
prison forty-two days altogether, and his health is
now very poor.</p>

<p>Another of my room-mates is John Carr, of Fauquier
County, Va.; he is a widower, who was
about to be married. As he was journeying on to the
home of his intended bride, where all the preparations
had been made for the approaching nuptials, he was
rudely seized by a scouting party and landed here in
the Old Capitol. He has been unfortunate in his
matrimonial ventures. He was married to his second
wife a few years before the war, and started on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
bridal tour through some of the Western States. It
happened that the cholera was raging at the time in
some parts of the West, and while going down the
Mississippi River on a steamboat his wife was suddenly
taken ill with cholera and died on the boat. The
passengers became frightened and put him ashore
with the dead body of his wife at a desolate spot on the
banks of the river, at night and in a heavy storm. He
was compelled to remain there through the long,
dreary night, sitting beside the corpse, holding a
blanket over it to protect it from the rain, and keep
the wind from blowing away the covering. The
splash of the water, the puffing and snorting of the
boats on the river, with the shrill blast of their whistles
or the bellowing of their signals in passing each other,
found an echo in the moaning and shrieking of the
angry wind. These mingled sounds to the sad watcher
in his lonely vigil seemed a requiem for the dead.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, Feb. 24.</i>&mdash;Three of the prisoners brought
in last Saturday were Italians&mdash;Peter Eorio, Raphael
Rinaldi and Marco Comastri. They appear to be very
intelligent men, and I have derived much pleasure
from conversing with them. They have been in this
country about three years. Living in the South, and
wishing to return to their native country, they asked
and received permission from the Confederate authorities
to pass through the lines; having first procured
certificates to the effect that they were citizens
of Italy and as to their intentions. On their arrival
in Washington they were arrested and brought to
this place.</p>

<p>To-day the Commission appointed to try political
prisoners commenced their sittings.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>Fourteen prisoners were sent off to-day upon taking
the oath. Quite a number have been released lately
by so doing. Many of them say they do not regard the
oath&mdash;that it is unconstitutional, unlawful, and not in
any sense binding.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span><i>Wednesday, Feb. 25.</i>&mdash;This morning one of the
negroes in the breakfast room accused a prisoner of
taking two pieces of bread instead of one, which is
supposed to be one man&#8217;s portion. Although the
man denied having done so, the negro persisted in
saying he had, and the man was put in the guard
house.</p>

<p>Peter and John Flaherty were called before Parker.
They are British subjects and are provided with
British protection. They had been at work for some
time in Richmond, and were on their way North when
arrested. Parker asked them why they left Richmond.
&#8220;Thinking to do better, sir,&#8221; promptly replied Peter.
They were released with the injunction to leave the
city within forty-eight hours.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, Feb. 26.</i>&mdash;Three more prisoners brought
into our room&mdash;twenty-nine now in all. Some Yankee
sutlers were brought in lately. They are very bitter
in denouncing the Federal Government.</p>

<p>It is rumored an attempt will be made by some of
the prisoners to escape. The matter was talked over
to-day in our room. Many plans were suggested as
being feasible and attended with but little danger.
One said it would be an easy matter, when we were
out in the yard, and the wagon came in to deliver
bread, for the prisoners to make a rush for the gate,
and before the gate could be closed quite a number
could get out.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the guards would fire on us, and some of us
would be killed,&#8221; said Fax Minor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; was the reply, &#8220;somebody might be
shot&mdash;perhaps killed. We must expect that. But
many would get away safely.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>&#8220;Yes, that is all true,&#8221; returned Fax; &#8220;but just
suppose there was only one killed, and that one was
poor Fax&mdash;what then?&#8221;</p>

<p>A noticeable character in the prison yard at one time
during the half-hour allowed for recreation was a
Hebrew named Fleggenheimer. He was captured
while attempting to run the blockade on the Potomac,
and his goods confiscated. Like Rachel of old, he
would not be comforted, but was continually bewailing
his loss. One of my room-mates, John Pentz, of Baltimore,
finding that sympathy only added fuel to the
fire of his distress, sought to divert his thoughts into
another channel by bantering him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Sledgehammer&#8221; (as Pentz was accustomed to
call him), &#8220;don&#8217;t worry; you&#8217;ll soon be out of this
place, and it won&#8217;t take you long to make up what you
lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but, Mr. Benty, I lose more ash five t&#8217;ousand
dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you can get that back in the profit of one
good trip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And den it vash all borrowed monish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then that is so much the better&mdash;<i>you</i> won&#8217;t lose
anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t know all, Mr. Benty. My poor
wife, she yust git a leetle baby, unt ven she hear dis
it makes her right down stone dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>From conversations had with Western prisoners,
I judge there is more intense bitterness of feeling in
the West, particularly in Missouri and Kentucky, than
in the Eastern border section. One old Missourian
in our room said he was from Schuyler County, and
had been in prison since the 12th of August. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
one of the prisoners in the Court House, named Ford,
was shot with a pistol by one of the guards.</p>

<p>He said the Union men were called &#8220;Sheepskins,&#8221;
and they perpetrated the most villainous outrages.
That on one occasion a party arrested a man, and
while carrying him through the village, some little
boys playing marbles, cried out: &#8220;Here comes the
militia,&#8221; and ran away. One of the &#8220;Sheepskins&#8221;
fired into the crowd of children and killed a boy twelve
years old. They picked the child up, carried him to his
home, and threw him in the door to his mother, saying:
&#8220;Here is one we&#8217;ve kept from growing up to be a
damned Secesh.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another man told me he was in prison with some of
the men who were executed by General McNeil. He
said he was playing cards with Wade when he was
called out. Wade put down his cards, saying he knew
he was called out to be killed. There was among the
doomed men one old man with a large and helpless
family. A brave young hero volunteered to take the
old man&#8217;s place, saying he had none to leave behind
to regret him or feel the loss. He was accepted.
His savage executioners, dumb to this noble exhibition
of heroism and self-sacrifice, sent him off on his coffin
with the others.</p>

<p>I afterward learned the facts concerning this brutal
tragedy:</p>

<p>In the Fall of 1862, the Confederates, under Colonel
James Porter, captured the town of Palmyra, and during
their occupancy a man named Andrew Allsman,
an ex-soldier of the Third Missouri Cavalry (said to
have been a spy), disappeared.</p>

<p>After the Confederates evacuated the town and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
McNeil returned, he learned of the abduction of Allsman,
and thereupon issued a notice, that unless
Allsman was returned within ten days he would retaliate
upon the Rebel prisoners then in his hands. At
the expiration of the ten days, ten prisoners then in
his custody: Willis Baker, Thomas Humston,
Morgan Bixler, and John Y. McPheeters, of Lewis
County; Herbert Hutson, John M. Wade and Marion
Lair, of Ralls County; Captain Thomas A. Sidner,
Monroe County; Eleazer Lake, Scotland County, and
Hiram Smith, Knox County, were selected&mdash;ten men,
to give up their lives for one man <i>missing</i>.</p>

<p>Three Government wagons drove to the jail, with
ten rough board coffins. The condemned men were
taken from the prison, seated upon their coffins in the
wagons, and driven to the place of execution&mdash;the
Fair Ground. There the coffins were arranged in a
row, six or eight feet apart. Thirty soldiers of the
Second Missouri State Militia were drawn up in line
facing the coffins. The ten men knelt upon the grass
between the coffins. A prayer was offered up by Rev.
R. M. Rhoades, and the prisoners each took his seat
upon the foot of his coffin. Two accepted bandages;
the others refused. The officer in command then
stepped forward and gave the command: &#8220;Ready&mdash;aim&mdash;fire!&#8221;
Two of the prisoners fell backward upon
their coffins, dead. Captain Sidner sprang forward
and fell with his face to the soldiers, and died immediately.
He had requested the soldiers to aim at his
heart. The other seven were not killed, and the reserves
were called and put an end to their lives with
their revolvers.</p>

<p>Among the Camp Chase prisoners are three little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
boys, their ages ranging from ten to fourteen. I saw
one in the yard to-day. The men called him &#8220;John
Morgan&#8217;s Orderly.&#8221; He was dressed in gray and
seemed a shrewd, bright little fellow. He told me he
was fourteen years of age. That he had been with
John Morgan, and was captured while carrying a
letter from General John C. Breckenridge to General
John Morgan. He said he had been in prison thirteen
months.</p>

<p>The second boy was held on charges similar to the
one first mentioned. The third, and youngest, says he
does not know why he was arrested, or why he was
brought here.</p>

<p><i>Friday, Feb. 27.</i>&mdash;Boyd Barrett and others, ill with
smallpox, were removed in ambulances to-day.</p>

<p>Messrs. Ayre, Carr, and Brawner were called to-day
and the oath offered them. They refused to take it
and were marked for exchange.</p>

<p>It is said one of the prison officials was going around
the yard last night, dressed in Confederate uniform,
endeavoring, by offering bribes, to test the fidelity of
the guards.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, Feb. 28.</i>&mdash;I slept but little last night.
Some prisoners who were put in the room were very
noisy, and I was cold. I had one sheet and one
blanket, and I had to take my overcoat for a covering.
When I got warmed up, the mice became lively and
commenced a game of tag. They appear to think it
fine fun chasing one another under the board pillow
at my head, and then running over my bunk and crawling
about through the folds of my blanket. When I
shake them off they scamper away, only to return when
they see I am quiet again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>There is also a large force of bedbugs in the room,
and they send out detachments and raiding parties to
all the different bunks, and draw their full supply of
rations from the occupants. Sometimes we get
together and have a round-up, and a promiscuous
slaughter, regardless of age or sex. But they must recruit
from the other side, like the Yankee army, as
we can notice no diminution in the forces. I suppose,
like the poor, we will always have them with us.</p>

<p>Owing to the dirty and overcrowded condition of the
building, we have another pest in the shape of an insect,
smaller than the one just mentioned, but equally
bloodthirsty, who makes his presence felt, and has
reduced us to such a condition that we have to scratch
for a living.</p>

<p>This morning, while standing near the window, I
saw two little boys, ten or twelve years of age, standing
on the street corner, opposite the prison. They
were looking down the street and did not hear the
guard calling to them to leave the corner. Presently
a corporal was sent over and the children, now in the
act of moving on, were arrested and brought into the
prison. I stood at the window for some time, but I
did not see them pass out.</p>

<p>Six prisoners brought into our room to-day. Thirty-seven
now in the room, with bunks for twenty-one;
the balance sleep on the floor as best they can. At
night the floor is completely taken up by sleeping men,
so we can only walk the floor by stepping over them.
They roll themselves in their blankets and go to
sleep.</p>

<p>Frank Thornton released on parole to-day. John
Pentz went out at night.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>A man in Room 15 threw a piece of bread out of
the window into the street. In consequence of this,
all the inmates of the room, twenty-eight in number,
were confined to the room during the half-hour
usually allowed for recreation, and put on bread
and water diet&mdash;two pieces of bread being allowed
them daily.</p>

<p><i>Monday, March 2.</i>&mdash;Commission in session to-day.</p>

<p>The surgeon came in and made inquiries as to the
number in our room, etc. Thirty-nine in room&mdash;beds
for twenty-one. Call for all who desire to be vaccinated
to come into the hospital.</p>

<p>In the dull uniformity of prison life every trifling
event which breaks the monotony and diverts the attention,
for the time, from the unpleasant reality of
our situation is seized upon and becomes a subject of
conversation. To-day a drove of mules was passing
the prison on their way to some of the camps or
corrals, and this brought out a number of stories illustrating
peculiar traits or features of that useful
and much-abused creature&mdash;the mule.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the Confederate army was encamped at
Manassas,&#8221; said Bennett, &#8220;after the battle of Bull
Run, the mules, being fastened to the wagons by their
halters, after eating their supply of provender, would
start in, biting and chewing the feed-boxes and wagon
bodies. They were not satisfied with the quantity of
long-feed that was dealt out to them and sought to
make good the deficiency by chewing up the wagons.
To prevent the total demolition of wagons, details
of men were sent out daily to cut and bring in loads
of hoop-poles for belly-timber, as Bennett termed it.
These were spread out before the mules who no doubt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
found the wood in its crude state as appetizing as when
fashioned into wagons or feed-boxes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An old friend of mine, Dr. Green,&#8221; said John Carr,
&#8220;was at one time induced to purchase a lot of mules.
They were sold at a sacrifice, and knowing there was
a constant demand for mules in army circles, he flattered
himself that he had been cut out for a sharp
trader, but had always before that time missed his
opportunity; that he had made a good investment,
and now having the long-delayed opportunity, he
would surely get all there was in it. So when he had
paid his money he patted himself on the back&mdash;figuratively&mdash;in
a patronizing manner and turned a round
dozen well-conditioned mules into his pasture.</p>

<p>&#8220;In this field where he had put the mules his riding-horse
was accustomed to graze. A close intimacy
sprang up between the mules and the horse. On
Sunday, when Dr. Green brought up his horse in order
to attend service at the village church, he noticed a
commotion among the mules, but paid no further attention
to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;While riding to church with his wife, however, he
heard a noise on the road behind them, a tramping of
hoofs, with a nickering and braying. Soon the mules
came in sight, frisking about and apparently delighted
to overtake their newly-found friend and comrade,
the horse. They refused to be sent back, and the
Doctor and his wife rode into town to church at the
head of a drove of mules.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, March 3.</i>&mdash;Last night about midnight I
was awakened by a noise and great commotion in the
building. A man in the adjoining room cried out
lustily, &#8220;Fire! Fire!&#8221; Then there was a knocking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
at the doors. The flames were breaking out through a
board partition which cuts off a portion of our room,
making an entry to the adjoining room. The fire had
not gained much headway, however, and a little water
soon extinguished it. For a time there was great
confusion and excitement. The guard at the door,
as soon as he was aware of the fact, cried out
&#8220;Corporal of the guard, Post No. 5&mdash;Fire!&#8221; Then the
word was passed from sentinel to sentinel, until it
rang through the building. Men were jumping out
of their bunks, hastily putting on their clothes, some
cursing, calling for things they were unable to find&mdash;&#8220;Where&#8217;s
my pants?&#8221; &#8220;Where&#8217;s my boots?&#8221; In the
confusion one man would grab up an article belonging
to another&mdash;often a misfit. I lay quietly in my bunk
for a while. I felt there could be little danger from
fire occurring in the rooms occupied by either the
prisoners or guards; for if by any mischance a fire
should break out, it would soon be discovered and
quickly extinguished. Or, if in the outhouse or kitchen,
they, being small buildings, the fire could be put out
before it communicated to the main building&mdash;the
prison itself.</p>

<p>At the time of the greatest excitement one man said:
&#8220;Look out of the window and see the light. The building
is on fire.&#8221; When this light was found to proceed
from the rising moon, it had a quieting effect on the
panic. A sergeant came in with a light and searched
around to find out how the fire originated. After
this a lieutenant with a few privates came in under
arms, and examined thoroughly and questioned, but
no one appeared to know how it started. If the fire
had progressed to any great extent before discovery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
no doubt many of the prisoners would have escaped
as it would have been impossible for the guards to
have kept in check the large number of prisoners now
in the building.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, March 4.</i>&mdash;Congress adjourned to-day.
From the prison window we saw the flag lowered.</p>

<p>At night Superintendent Wood came to the door and
called me out of the room. He walked over and sat
at the foot of the stairs in the big hall leading to the
floor above, and told me to sit down beside him. He
asked me where I belonged. I said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a citizen of Washington. This is my home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What were you doing South?&#8221; asked Wood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Working at my business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you work?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At Ritchie &amp; Dunnavant&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of work was done there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They did the State printing and a portion of the
Government work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When did you go South?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just before the commencement of hostilities.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you get back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I came across the Potomac River.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t bring any letters, or anything of that
kind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I brought nothing but my wife and children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you willing to take an oath to support the
Government?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we will have to send you back South.&#8221;</p>

<p>I said, &#8220;Mr. Wood, I am in your hands, a prisoner,
and powerless to resist. I am obliged to submit to
whatever disposition you may make of me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>&#8220;A couple of gentlemen called to see me about you,&#8221;
said Mr. Wood, &#8220;and I am anxious to do all I can for
you. You know that this city is in a special manner
under the care and jurisdiction of the President and
Congress, and if you are a citizen of this place you
ought to submit to the law.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Mr. Wood,&#8221; said I, &#8220;there is no law to compel
me to take this oath.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You violated the law when you crossed the
Potomac.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In what manner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In running the blockade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This city is my home. I was South with my family.
How could I get home with them without crossing
the Potomac. What law did I violate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no time to spare,&#8221; said Mr. Wood, as he
arose and walked away, and I went back to my
room.</p>

<p>One more prisoner brought into our room&mdash;thirty-seven
now in.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, March 5.</i>&mdash;Boyd Barrett returned. He
had a slight attack of varioloid. Haskins, of South
Carolina, who was taken away with him, died of
smallpox. Another of the party is in a fair way of
recovery.</p>

<p>At night about one hundred and fifty Union soldiers
were brought in; mostly for desertion and insubordination.
They are very bitter in their denunciation
of the Government. They seem to care but little for
the guards, and do pretty much as they please.
Whether from fear or sympathy, the guards appear
indifferent to their words or behavior. Some of the
soldiers say they &#8220;enlisted to fight for the Union and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
not for the nigger.&#8221; One said, &#8220;If they bring up all
the men who are dissatisfied, the Government will
have to build more prisons.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Friday, March 6.</i>&mdash;My wife came to see me. A
corporal came up and escorted me down to the reception
room. On entering the room we were seated in
chairs placed opposite each other, and at a distance
of about three or four feet apart. Then a little puppy,
who acts as a clerk or detective, took his seat in a chair
which he drew up in front of, and between the chairs
occupied by myself and wife; where he could not fail
to hear every word that passed. Then he threw himself
back in his chair with an air of self-importance, as
if to say, &#8220;Now you can go on, with my permission.&#8221;
He interrupted our conversation several times by
volunteering remarks altogether uncalled for. My
wife said that my mother and she were worried about
me at home, as they heard I would be sent away.
Hearing this the fellow turned to a lieutenant who was
in the room, and asked in a tone which could be heard
across the room:</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you give me the number and names of the
prisoners in Rooms 15 and 16, as they are about to be
sent away?&#8221;</p>

<p>He knew I was in Room 16, and thought to annoy
us by asking this question. At the end of fifteen
minutes our conversation was abruptly brought to an
end. My wife was compelled to take the oath before
she was allowed to see me.</p>

<p>She told me that my son Henry had taken a change
for the better within an hour after I left him, at the
expiration of my parole, and, knowing I would be
anxious to hear about him, they sent me a message to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
that effect immediately. Two weeks have elapsed, but
the message has never been delivered.</p>

<p>Young Thomas Hurst was called down to
see his sister directly after my wife left, and he told
me he had the same experience as we had, and the
same remark was made in the presence of his sister
as that used to annoy my wife.</p>

<p>Three Federal soldiers confined here attempted to
escape by way of the cellar. Two succeeded and one
was caught.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, March 8.</i>&mdash;About 1:30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, one hundred
and fifty prisoners were brought in. They came from
St. Louis direct; they are mostly soldiers. They have
been in prison&mdash;some one, others three and five
months. With regard to the soldiers this is a violation
of the cartel by the United States authorities. The
cartel of exchange provides that prisoners of war be
discharged on parole within ten days after capture.
These expect to be exchanged about the 16th of this
month. They were brought through Baltimore, arriving
in this city last night, and were crowded in a
place which, from the description given, I judge to be
the Central Guard House. They say that they were
put into rooms where they were obliged to pass the
night in a standing posture, as there was not room
enough to lie down. After being brought here they
were kept standing in the damp yard (part of the time
it was raining), until after ten o&#8217;clock at night, when
they were removed to the adjoining houses (Duff
Green&#8217;s Row), Carroll Prison.</p>

<p>Two men, Wesley Phillips and Mitchell, were released
to-day. They were captains of schooners engaged
in carrying sutlers&#8217; stores to the Army of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
Potomac. They were Baltimoreans and very fine men.</p>

<p><i>Monday, March 9.</i>&mdash;Fine day. After a rain the
water drips from the window cornices or eaves of the
roof, to the ground, sometimes dropping over the
doorway. As some of the guards were on the doorstep
they caught the drops and said the men in our
room were spitting out of the window. A corporal
was sent to the room and although the men explained
the matter to him&mdash;said they had not spit out, and
called his attention to the falling drops, the window
was shut down and we are now forced to remain in
this close room, with no ventilation and the breaths
of thirty-seven men poisoning the air. Our keepers
appear to take pleasure in annoying and persecuting
those in their power, knowing they can do so without
fear or resistance or retaliation.</p>

<p>A man who either drunk or crazy, passing on the
opposite side of the street, looked up at the window
and seeing the crowd of prisoners, laughed and waved
his hat. The officer standing at the door said to the
sentry, &#8220;You had better bring that fellow in, anyhow.&#8221;
He was accordingly brought in.</p>

<p>There is a man in Room 16, named Armand. He
claims to be from Louisiana. He is of very dark complexion,
with black hair, short black beard and
mustache. He always wears a blue uniform, but I
never saw him with a hat, either indoors or out. He
is looked upon with suspicion and shunned by all.
By many he is thought to be a spy. If he goes out of
the room for any purpose whatever, the other prisoners
exchange knowing glances, and shake their heads in
a manner indicating distrust. Some do not hesitate
to say: &#8220;He is now going down to make his report to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
Wood.&#8221; Every act is observed and commented on.</p>

<p>No one cares to be seen speaking to him or noticing
him. If he approaches one with a pleasing expression
on his face, as if about to speak, the person so approached
will turn from him with a look of contempt,
or, if addressed, return a half-hearted reply, and with
a stealthy look around, as if to see if anyone observed
him, shy off in a direction opposite that in which
Armand appears to be going. Even the Yankee
prisoners are shown more consideration, and more
regard paid to their wants and advances. Men who
occasionally bestow upon him a look of pity&mdash;such
as they would give to a poor friendless dog&mdash;will
quickly turn away if he shows a disposition to return
a grateful acknowledgment.</p>

<p>Although I have no means of ascertaining whether
this treatment is deserved, or if he is unjustly suspected,
yet I cannot shut out from my breast a feeling
of pity for the poor fellow.</p>

<p>At night, when all others were soundly sleeping in
their bunks, I have often watched him as he paced
the floor or stood at the window, his hands folded behind
him, looking out into the deserted street, as lonely
and forsaken as himself, singing, or rather crooning in
a low, mournful, but not unmusical tone:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;When the sad, chilly winds of December,</div>
<div class="verse">Stole my flowers, my companions, from me.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p><i>Tuesday, March 10.</i>&mdash;Eorio, Comastro and Rinaldi,
the three Italians I have already mentioned, were
called before the Colonel acting in place of Parker,
who is sick.</p>

<p>He questioned them in regard to their arrest, etc.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
He told them there was no reason for keeping them
and they would be released to-morrow. Eorio
promised to see my wife and tell her what I could not
write her with any certainty of its being delivered.
This I learned afterward he did faithfully.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Love was again called before the colonel.
He had a certificate from the prison surgeon, stating
that he was ill. That the confinement was injuring
him, and he should be discharged. The Colonel told
him his case would have to go before the Commission.</p>

<p>One of the prison guards to-day snapped his gun
twice at a man passing on horseback, but it missed fire
each time.</p>

<p>Captain Thomas Phillips was released this afternoon.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, March 11.</i>&mdash;This morning as Keleher
was looking from the window, singing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;The niggers we will sell</div>
<div class="verse">And the Yankees send to hell,&#8221; etc.,</div>
</div></div>

<p>a little fussy lieutenant, named Thackery, came
bristling up, saying, &#8220;I&#8217;ll send <i>you</i> to hell,&#8221; and as if
intending to carry out his threat literally, rushed at
Keleher with his arm outstretched to push or grasp
him, but just before the hand touched him, Keleher
stepped to one side and Thackery, unable to check or
recover himself, went spinning halfway across the
room. The men, none of whom have any love or good
feeling for Thackery, laughed at his discomfiture, and
this so irritated the crestfallen lieutenant that he had
the guards take Keleher off to the guard house.</p>

<p>James Taylor and James Stant were called and took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
the oath not to attempt to run the blockade again.
Aaron Lewis released.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, March 12.</i>&mdash;Three more prisoners
brought into our room last night. One belonged to
Stuart&#8217;s Horse Artillery; the other two were citizens.</p>

<p>James Ewell released. Russell released; he had
British protection. Frank Thornton, who had been out
on parole, returned.</p>

<p>A man confined in the guard house knocked down
a portion of the partition. He was taken out and tied
up by the wrists to a tree. He broke the cords after
a time and released himself. He was then removed,
but I do not know what was done with him after.</p>

<p>Among my room-mates I have discovered an old
schoolmate, Thomas Holbrook, of Baltimore. He and
I were schoolboys together at a school kept by Martin
J. Kerney, in a little one-story brick building, situated
on Exeter Street, between Baltimore and Fayette, Baltimore
City. Mr. Kerney was a graduate of Mount
St. Mary&#8217;s College, Emmittsburg, Md. After giving
up school teaching he entered into the practice of law
and was afterward a member of the Maryland State
Legislature. He was the author of a number of educational
works, some of which are still used. Three
of the Booth brothers&mdash;Edwin, the celebrated actor;
John Wilkes, who shot Lincoln, and Joseph Adrian
Booth, who afterward became a physician, and also
John Sleeper Clarke, the comedian, who later on
married Asia Booth, a sister of the Booth brothers,
were all attending this school at the same time with us.
Holbrook is quite a valuable addition to our company.
He is exceedingly clever in handling playing cards
and often amuses us with exhibitions of tricks, in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
he displays remarkable dexterity. He thus helps us
while away many a tedious hour. He was at one time
in the Navy, and, like all seafaring men, is handy about
the house. We all are glad when it is Tom&#8217;s day in
the kitchen as cook for the mess. He will say, &#8220;Well,
boys, what will it be to-day&mdash;lobscouse or skilligalee?&#8221;</p>

<p>He will take a ham-bone, from which most of the
meat has been cut, and sitting down will patiently
pick off with a pocket-knife every scrap of fat and
lean, and with the addition of a few potatoes or other
ingredients, will serve up quite a tasty little side dish
for our table.</p>

<p>An old man who had been confined here for some
time, was released a few days ago. He was bent with
age, and very feeble and childish, so that when here
he would often get lost in the building. After wandering
about for some time he came back. He said
he thought the war was over when he was sent off.
That he was away from home; 84 years of age; with
no place to go and no means of getting to his home.
He begged to be taken back.</p>

<p>At night a sergeant came into the room with a list
of names which he called over; my name being among
the number. He asked each one if he wanted to go to
Richmond. All those who are booked for Richmond
are greatly elated at the prospect of their release from
prison and a trip to Dixie. Whiskey was smuggled in
and several of the fortunate ones were quite lively.
Very little sleep to-night for anyone here.</p>

<p>Fitzhugh Carter, or as he was familiarly called
&#8220;Chew Carter,&#8221; was a sprightly little fellow from
Fauquier County, Virginia. Brought up on a farm
and enjoying in his early life the companionship of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
the little darkies, he had acquired much of their quaint
dialect and rollicking manners. On this night Chew
had by some means got more than a fair share of the
smuggled whiskey.</p>

<p>When the lieutenant came in for roll-call, it was
the custom for the prisoners to form in one line, while
the lieutenant with the guard would stand at the
head, and as each man&#8217;s name was called he would step
out, turn and face the line he had just left. This would
be repeated until, when all the names were called, the
new line would be formed opposite that formerly occupied
by the first line.</p>

<p>As it was a difficult matter for poor Chew to preserve
his equilibrium, his comrades endeavored to keep
him steady on the perpendicular by bracing him on
either side. All went well until it came his turn to
answer. When the officer called &#8220;Fitzhugh Carter,&#8221;
Chew stood erect, pushed his hat back from his forehead
and snapped out &#8220;Yer, sah!&#8221; and lurched forward
to the line opposite. The loud and jerky way he was
answered appeared to strike the lieutenant, for he
raised his head and looked to where the sound came
from and then cast his eyes down again to his roll.
Just at this moment Chew, apparently satisfied with
the accomplishment of his little feat, looked toward
the head of the line and observing the action of the
lieutenant, said &#8220;Who de hell keers foh yo&#8217; damn ol&#8217;
roll-call?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lieutenant heard the voice, but did not catch
the words. He looked down the line. The men who
stood on either side of Chew nudged him to keep
quiet, and all looked so innocent of any wrong-doing
that the officer evidently disbelieved his ears, if they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
carried a trace of the actual words uttered, for he
proceeded with his roll-call without further interruption.</p>

<p>When the lieutenant left the room one of his comrades
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Chew, where did you get it all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jis&#8217; had one drink,&#8221; replied Chew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you must have tapped a still-house,&#8221; said
Ed. O&#8217;Brien, and he sung&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;The man that has good whiskey</div>
<div class="indent">And giveth his neighbor none,</div>
<div class="verse">Sha&#8217;n&#8217;t have any of my good whiskey</div>
<div class="indent">When his good whiskey is gone.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;When&mdash;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Now, altogether&#8221;&mdash;(and all took up the refrain):</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;When his good whiskey is gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was one little incident during Chew&#8217;s sojourn
in the Old Capitol which proved that the course of love
does run smoothly sometimes&mdash;even love of whiskey.
Chew was very thirsty, and was determined to quench
that thirst. At &#8220;Sick Call,&#8221; he joined the throng who
wended their way to the hospital.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so sick. I got sich cramps. Bin sick all
night,&#8221; said Chew, as he entered the hospital, with one
hand clutching a portion of his garments covering
the part of his anatomy where cramps are supposed to
locate, and the other pressed against his forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you a dose of castor oil,&#8221; said the hospital
steward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Chew, &#8220;I kaint take castoh oil. Nevah
could take it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fix it up so you won&#8217;t taste it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use, I know. You&#8217;ll hav&#8217;ter give me somethin&#8217;
else.&#8221;</p>

<p>The steward poured a little whiskey in the bottom
of a glass; then poured in the oil, which was quite stiff,
and after that put whiskey on top. Chew took the glass
and with a quick toss gulped down the whiskey before
the oil had fairly started to flow, and handed the glass
back, saying: &#8220;Take it quick. I&#8217;m afeerd I&#8217;ll throw
it up&#8221;&mdash;at the same time making such grimaces that
one would think he really had swallowed a nauseous
dose.</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t taken any of the oil,&#8221; said the steward.
&#8220;Here; drink it down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I got a big mouthful, an&#8217; I&#8217;m pow&#8217;ful sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll put some more whiskey on top. Drink it quick
and you won&#8217;t taste it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did drink it jis&#8217; ez quick ez I could. I&#8217;ll try, but
I know it won&#8217;t stay down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Taking the glass he tossed off the whiskey from the
top, as before, and leaving the oil. The steward, now
seeing through the trick, said: &#8220;You can take that
now as it is, for I will not put another drop of whiskey
in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Chew, as he moved toward the door,
&#8220;I dun told ye I couldn&#8217;t take castoh oil. I nevah could
take it. I drink&#8217;t it quick ez I could. I kin take
mos&#8217; ennything better&#8217;n castoh oil.&#8221; He came back
to his room where he told of the success of his scheme
to his laughing companions.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, March 14.</i>&mdash;Last night we got the daily
papers&mdash;the first for several days. In the kitchen the
cooks were at work nearly all night to have the
rations ready for to-day. It was reported that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
prisoners would leave about ten o&#8217;clock in the morning.
All day the streets were filled with people eager
for a glance at the Rebels. About 2 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, orders came
to pack up, and about 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, they left the prison.
Seventeen were taken from Room 16. Guards were
placed in line along the sidewalks and in the Capitol
grounds to keep back the crowd who had assembled to
witness the departure. There were ambulances for the
old, infirm, sick and wounded. The soldiers expected
to leave to-day, but were left behind, with the exception
of a few of the wounded.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, March 15.</i>&mdash;It seems lonely to-day on account
of the change&mdash;we miss so many familiar faces.
It seems like a break in the family. Six more prisoners
were put in our room, making twenty-one in all.
There are two cases of smallpox in the next room.</p>

<p><i>Monday, March 16.</i>&mdash;This morning the prisoners
from Room 14, were crowded into our room while
that room was being cleaned and whitewashed. There
are twenty-one of them&mdash;some are broken out with
smallpox.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, March 17.</i>&mdash;The men having smallpox,
who were put in our room yesterday from Room
14 were to-day put in Room 18. If they are changed
around a few more times the disease will be pretty
well spread.</p>

<p>Two men, father and son, just brought in, were
captured in a raid on the Potomac River. They are
citizens. Their families are left without support or
protection. The wife of one about being confined.
Both men agreed to take the oath, but were told that as
they would do so only on account of their situation
they would not be released.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>Volney Purcell, of Loudoun County, Virginia, was
called to-day. Colonel Buell asked him what charges
were against him. He replied he did not know. Purcell
then asked Colonel Buell if <i>he</i> knew. Buell said he did
not; there was nothing that he could see. Purcell
then said: &#8220;Can you not release me, then?&#8221; &#8220;No,&#8221;
said Buell, &#8220;I cannot.&#8221; Purcell said he thought it
very strange that he should be brought from his home
and kept here without any charge. Buell said it was
strange, but his case would have to go before the Commission.</p>

<p>The prison yard is now in a very filthy condition.
In rainy weather a great part of the space allowed the
prisoners for exercise is covered with mud.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, March 18.</i>&mdash;I was called to-day by
Colonel Buell. After questioning me regarding my
arrest and imprisonment, he asked if I would take the
oath.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;What,&#8221; said he, &#8220;not willing to take the oath. I
will acknowledge that my sympathies were enlisted
in your behalf, but your refusal to take the oath
puts an entirely different face on the matter. Had
you told me that at first it might have saved this
examination. In fact, you need not have left your
room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What charges are against me?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;If there
are any, let me have a fair trial, as is my right, and if
I am found guilty I am willing to suffer punishment,
but if there are none you have no right to keep me
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a very exalted opinion of the leniency of
this Government, to think that after having been South<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
you could be permitted to come back here and live
without taking the oath.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said I, &#8220;I have no reason to have a very
exalted opinion of the leniency of this Government.
I had a right to go where I pleased before the blockade
was established, and afterward had a right to come
to my home where I belonged. I would not take that
oath if it were offered to me at the South, and I do
not see how any man can honestly take it with the
intention of keeping it&mdash;&#8216;to support, protect and defend
a government or administration, <i>now and hereafter,
under any and all circumstances</i>.&#8217; How do I know
what may be done hereafter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have taken that oath,&#8221; said Colonel Buell.</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be,&#8221; said I; &#8220;your views and mine differ
on the subject of right and wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go back to your room, sir,&#8221; said Buell, and that
terminated the interview.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, March 19.</i>&mdash;An officer came up to-day
with a paper and called over the names of seven in our
room (Room 16)&mdash;Holbrook, Barnes, Littlepage,
Keleher, Hoyle, Simmons and myself, and at night we
were removed to Room 10. With the three prisoners
already in the room there are ten of us now in a small
room with two bunks and three small beds. Room 10
is on the north side of the building, third story, first
window from the corner on First Street.</p>

<p><i>Friday, March 20.</i>&mdash;The prisoners brought in numbered
twenty-five instead of seventy-five as reported
in the daily papers, where it is stated that they were
taken in a fight with Stuart&#8217;s Cavalry, and that nothing
but the saber was used. The prisoners say the
Federals had artillery and used it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span><i>Sunday, March 22.</i>&mdash;Two elderly ladies, with a small
child, were brought in from the street for saluting
prisoners.</p>

<p>The prison officials are taking the names of soldiers
to-day preparatory to exchange.</p>

<p><i>Monday, March 23.</i>&mdash;It is said that the private
soldiers will be sent off to-morrow. The officers will
not go.</p>

<p>One of the prison guards, named Highland, who
has always acted very kindly toward the prisoners
while on post, and has made many friends among
them, told me that two young ladies have been brought
in and are now confined in Duff Green&#8217;s Row (Carroll
Prison). He does not know who they are or what
charges are against them. I understand a number
of citizens from the neighborhood of Fairfax Court
House have been arrested and brought in since
Mosby&#8217;s raid and capture of General Stoughton, and
these ladies may be of that number.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<p><i>Tuesday, March 24.</i>&mdash;I have been suffering from
severe cold for several days. Our room is small, close
and ill-ventilated, and here we are kept penned up,
with the exception of the time we are allowed out at
meal times. Then we are out in a damp yard, which
is so crowded when there is a large number of
prisoners here (as at the present time,) that there
is little room for comfortable exercise. In this yard
we stand for about a half-hour, consequently nearly
all of us are troubled with colds.</p>

<p>The prisoners booked for exchange are here yet, and
it is hard to say when they will leave. It is reported<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
that a number of prisoners are expected from Camp
Chase or some other place, and that is a reason given
for the delay.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, March 25.</i>&mdash;At night, a short time before
roll-call, the clerk came up and inquired if all in
the room were &#8220;State&#8221; prisoners. Receiving an affirmative
reply, he asked who wanted to go to Dixie.
Simmons, Barnes and myself answered &#8220;Here.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">OFF FOR DIXIE</h2>
</div>


<p><i>Thursday, March 26.</i>&mdash;Could not sleep last night.
Got up about twelve or one o&#8217;clock, took a smoke and
then lay down until near daylight. I then got up and
went down to the prison yard. I understand a batch
of prisoners were brought in about eleven o&#8217;clock last
night. I heard a great tramping of feet at that time.</p>

<p>At three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon, all who expected
to go to Richmond were called down in the yard and
the roll called by Superintendent Wood. When he
came to my name he asked where I was taken.</p>

<p>I said &#8220;Here, in Washington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What were you doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the store, attending to my business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand back. You can&#8217;t go.&#8221;</p>

<p>I went back to my room, giving up the idea of getting
away then. Some things I had sent for had not
arrived, so I was disappointed in more than one respect,
and was about settling myself down, when
Adamson called out to me&mdash;&#8220;Get your things and
come on.&#8221; I hurried down, and when I passed out
the prisoners were in front of Duff Green&#8217;s Row. Littlepage,
Keleher, Holbrook and Hoyle, poor fellows,
looked lonely enough when we left them.</p>

<p>After receiving the prisoners from Carroll Prison,
the cavalcade moved on past the Capitol and through
the streets, to the foot of Sixth Street, where a crowd
of ladies were waiting and bade us adieu, waving their
handkerchiefs in spite of all protests from the guards,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
who at last drove them from the wharf at the point of
the bayonet.</p>

<p>We were then put on board the flag-of-truce boat,
the steamer <i>State of Maine</i>, and left the city at night.
About seven or eight o&#8217;clock, bread, crackers and
cheese were given out to the prisoners&mdash;some got a
good share, while others were served with three soda
crackers each. This was the first food given us since
breakfast in the Old Capitol. In the effort to get the
prisoners off we failed to get any dinner, although we
left the prison fully three or four hours after the
regular dinner hour.</p>

<p>Six of us secured three staterooms by paying $1,
each for the trip. Here we were very comfortable,
with good berths, etc. Many who were not so fortunate
had to sleep on the floor or on trunks, boxes,
or anything they could find handy.</p>

<p>It was an agreeable change when we were once on
board the steamer. To be where no guards with
bristling bayonets were continually meeting you to remind
you that you were a prisoner. Where no sentinel
challenged you at every turn. With no one calling
after you if you made a false move or deviated in the
slightest from prison discipline.</p>

<p><i>Friday, March 27.</i>&mdash;Awoke about eight or nine
o&#8217;clock this morning&mdash;our boat was steaming down
the Potomac River, Westmoreland County, Virginia,
on the one side, and St. Mary&#8217;s County, Maryland, on
the other. Breakfast was over, but Wright brought
me some bread and sausage. In the rush for dinner I
had my coat-tail torn off and was pretty well shaken
up.</p>

<p>This afternoon we anchored off Fortress Monroe.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
At night half a dozen prisoners were brought over to
the steamer from the fortress. They have been at
the fort for a week. They are from the West&mdash;some
Morgan&#8217;s men.</p>

<p>I saw Captain Darling making a bed for himself on
a hard bench and invited him to share my stateroom,
which he did. He said he had a very high opinion of
the patriotism of the citizens of Washington, particularly
the ladies, and spoke with warmth of the
parting scene at the wharf, where the Federal guards
brought their guns to a charge on the ladies and drove
them off.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, March 28.</i>&mdash;Awoke about seven o&#8217;clock.
Still at anchor between Fortress Monroe and the Rip
Raps. Two English war ships anchored off in the
Roads. Many of our company are complaining of
seasickness. I felt a little dizzy and weak before
breakfast, but went below and got a cup of coffee, a
slice of bread and a piece of fat pork. After eating
this I felt better. Sea quite high for some time. A
heavy rain storm came up about ten o&#8217;clock, with
thunder and lightning. The water then became calmer
but the rain continued.</p>

<p>At 12:45 the captain came over from Fortress
Monroe and we started from the anchorage in the
midst of a heavy rain. The guard here left us, good-naturedly
bidding us good-bye and hoping to meet us
soon in more peaceful times. They were of Company
K, Third New York Regiment, and were on the best of
terms with us during the trip.</p>

<p>When opposite Newport News, saw the wrecks of
the United States frigates <i>Cumberland</i> and <i>Congress</i>,
sunk in the fight with the Confederate iron-clad <i>Virginia</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
(<i>Merrimac</i>),<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> on the 8th of March, 1862. A
portion of one mast only of the <i>Congress</i> being visible,
while we could see parts of three masts of the <i>Cumberland</i>
and a part of the bowsprit above the water.
They were but a short distance from the shore, off
the point. A little beyond we saw the United States
steamer <i>Minnesota</i> and two other vessels, ironclads,
and a little farther off the <i>Monitor</i> lay floating at
ease.</p>

<p>Hundreds of sea-gulls hovered around our boat,
circling overhead, occasionally stopping in their flight
and beating the air with their wings, then floating
along like a boat on smooth water, darting down now
and then, attracted by the pieces of bread and scraps
of food thrown into the water by the men on board,
all the while uttering a peculiar cry resembling the
creaking of an old wagon wheel in need of oiling. A
man on the lower deck threw a piece of coal into the
flock which struck one of the birds, apparently breaking
a wing, as it fell over into the water, helpless. The
rest of the flock ceased following us and gathered
round their wounded companion, who lay on top of the
water. They fluttered around him, chattering and seemingly
endeavoring to aid or save him. Soon, however,
they again gathered around us and seemed to forget
their loss in their efforts to catch the tempting morsels
thrown to them from the boat.</p>

From Fortress Monroe to Richmond</p>

<p>How rudely cut off from life. How soon forgotten,
poor bird. But how like man the conduct of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
birds. A poor mortal is stricken down in the midst of
his cares and his enjoyments. Friends and relatives
cluster about him and pour forth their lamentations.
But how soon does their grief wear off, and they are
carried away in the whirl of excitement of the giddy,
thoughtless world, and all is forgotten.</p>




<p>A guard-boat hailed us, and the captain in reply
said that we were going to City Point with five hundred
Confederate prisoners, for exchange. &#8220;All
right,&#8221; was the answer from the guard-boat. Two
hundred and forty prisoners were brought to the Old
Capitol the night before we left, and we left there
with four hundred and eighty-eight.</p>

<p>I lay down and took a nap in the afternoon. When
I awoke the rain had ceased, but the clouds hung
lowering overhead and the muttering thunder was
sullenly giving out angry growls.</p>

<p>We were then in the James River, and passing in
sight of Jamestown, the first settlement in Virginia.
There are no houses on the island. The brick walls
of one of the old houses and chimneys of two outhouses
are in sight. These were destroyed by the
Union troops. We could also see the remains of the
batteries erected by the Confederates. An old church
tower is all that remains of a church built in Colonial
times.</p>

<p>A colored boy came to our stateroom and said if
we wished to keep it we should come down to the
clerk&#8217;s office and re-engage it. Wright said he would
like to keep it, but had no money. I sent down a bill
and paid for the room for the night. After sundown
it cleared off beautifully, and the sky was bright and
clear. Our boat anchored in mid-stream, with a white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
flag at the fore and the United States flag flying at
the peak.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, March 29.</i>&mdash;When I awoke this morning
the boat was steaming up the James River, a little
below the mouth of the Chickahominy River. We
soon came to Westover, originally the residence of
Colonel William Byrd, who was in his day one of the
most accomplished gentlemen in the Colony, and Westover
was noted for the magnificence of the buildings,
the beauty of the situation and the charms of its
society. Next came Harrison&#8217;s Landing, a place made
memorable by the retreat of McClellan&#8217;s army from
before Richmond, after the seven days&#8217; fight. From
this point it was but a short run to City Point, where
we cast anchor in the stream opposite the landing.</p>

<p>Here we were gladdened by the sight of a small
Confederate flag waving from a house on a bluff
opposite, and at the landing a sentinel in Confederate
gray paced up and down. A few soldiers appeared on
a hill near by, and some distance above City Point we
could see flags waving&mdash;first white and then red.
This was a signal station. One of our men had been
in the Signal Service and he explained its workings
to us. Captain John E. Mulford, United States Agent
of Exchange, went ashore in a boat and soon after
returned and said the Confederate authorities had
been notified of our arrival and we would be sent
off as soon as they came down for us.</p>

<p>Last night there were no rations given out, and this
morning we got nothing but a piece of fat pork and a
slice of bread&mdash;no coffee. Meals were served up on
the boat at 50 cents a head.</p>

<p>About 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the anchor was hauled up and two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
hundred and eighty-five soldiers, including those from
the Old Capitol, and a portion of the soldiers from
Johnson&#8217;s Island, were landed at the wharf. Cars
were in readiness to take them to Petersburg. They
went off in high spirits, all apparently rejoiced to find
themselves again free.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_096.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>J. H. Barnes.</i></p>

<p>City Point is at the confluence of the James and
Appomattox Rivers. The railroad runs along the
shore and the land rises abruptly a short distance
back from the river bank, forming in many places
high bluffs. The wharves, which extended along
the whole front of the town, have been destroyed,
and nothing remains of them but the charred
tops of the piles which supported them. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
houses along the shore in front of the steep banks, are
all more or less injured and many completely demolished.
Great holes are seen through the sides and
roofs, made by shot and shell.</p>

<p>At night saw signal station on James River in full
operation. Flags are used by day and lights at night.</p>

<p><i>Monday, March 30.</i>&mdash;Barnes asked Captain Mulford
if citizens, after being exchanged, could return to their
homes within the Federal lines without being subject
to arrest. Captain Mulford said the same charge
which led to their arrest in the first instance could
be again brought against them, and he said he would
advise all who were exchanged to keep outside of the
lines, unless they came with Morgan, Stuart, or some
one who could take them back safely.</p>

<p>About one o&#8217;clock a train came down from Petersburg,
with the Confederate States Commissioner of
Exchange, Robert Ould. Soon the United States
steamer <i>Henry Burden</i> came up with a flag-of-truce,
and made fast alongside. She brought Colonel Ludlow,
United States Commissioner. About 4:45 we
were put on the cars and taken to Petersburg.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PAROLE CAMP</h2>
</div>


<p>Arriving at Petersburg, we were marched through
the city to Parole Camp at Model Farm Barracks.
Here we went to headquarters and registered our
names. Bennett took me to his quarters and gave me
some supper&mdash;bacon and crackers. On the boat we
had nothing but bread and coffee toward the last, and
the meat was quite a luxury. It was of good quality,
too.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, March 31.</i>&mdash;When I awoke this morning
I had to turn over two or three times to supple my
joints. The bunk I slept in was hard boards, and our
covering for the two was a small shawl and one overcoat.
It was a cold, rainy night and my bed was cold. Still,
I am satisfied to put up with this lack of comfort to
be out of prison and among friends once more. I saw
James F. Kerfoot, a room-mate from the Old Capitol.
Crowds of negroes flock around the camp with pies,
bread and fried chicken, etc. If you ask the price
of anything they will answer&mdash;&#8220;A dollar.&#8221; Four pies,
$1, and everything in dollar parcels, as though
that was the lowest current value known in ordinary
traffic.</p>

<p>Parole Camp is located at what was formerly an
Agricultural Fair Ground. Here twelve of us are
quartered in one end of an old stable. We drew our
rations&mdash;rice, sugar, salt, bacon and three biscuits
each. We put one of these big round biscuits or
crackers in a little tin plate, heat some water in a skillet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
and pour over the biscuit, then turn another tin plate
over it and leave for a few minutes. On removing
the upper tin plate the biscuit will be found to have
swelled out so that it fills the plate. A piece of fat
pork or bacon is now put in the skillet, and when the
fat is well fried out the biscuit is put in the hot fat
and placed over the fire, and to a hungry man living
in the open air it is a first-class luxury on a bill of
fare, where the great fault is that, like Sam Weller&#8217;s
love letter, it is too short, and makes you wish there
was more of it. The supply of wood is light&mdash;rations
only five or six sticks.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_099.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Albert Wrenn</i></p>

<p>Jack Barnes, Albert Wrenn and Frank Fox went to
Petersburg on an old pass and came back at night,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
bringing with them a canteen of whiskey, for which
they paid $6.50 per quart.</p>

<p>We have only two bunks in our quarters. While we
take turns with these the rest of the party have to sleep
on the floor or sit up around the fire. The building is
open to the wind, and so cold that it is impossible to
sleep comfortably.</p>

<p>At Parole Camp I see a great many prisoners who
have been incarcerated in Northern prisons, principally
Camp Chase, Camp Douglas, and Johnson&#8217;s
Island. They all corroborate the statements made to
me by the Western prisoners with whom I conversed
while in the Old Capitol regarding the treatment of
prisoners.</p>

<p>I was speaking to one of my companions who was
complaining of the short rations and cold comforts at
Camp Parole, when one of the released prisoners who
had but recently arrived, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You should not complain of the fare and treatment
here. It is nothing compared to what we had to go
through on Johnson&#8217;s Island. Of course it is hard living
here, but we know it can&#8217;t be helped; there was no
excuse for it there. What we suffered there was from
pure cussedness. The Yankees have plenty of everything
and could certainly give prisoners enough to eat
if they chose&mdash;plain, cheap food&mdash;enough to sustain
life in a healthy condition, but they didn&#8217;t. Some
prisoners would eat their day&#8217;s rations at one meal;
others would make two meals of it. Salt beef, salt
pork, salt fish and bread was doled out to us for
months; no coffee, tea or sugar; no vegetables, except
very rarely an onion or potato. Consequently, men
suffered with scurvy so that their gums were bleeding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
and sometimes their teeth fell out. Old bones were
broken up and boiled, and scraps of food were culled
out from the hospital slop-barrels. Rats and cats
were eaten by the hungry men when they could catch
them. For a time prisoners were allowed to receive
food from friends outside, but an order was published
denying them this privilege.</p>

<p>&#8220;For trifling offences Confederate officers were compelled
to stand on the head of a barrel between the
dead-line and the prison wall, and one officer while
standing in the door of Block 12 was killed by a
sentinel. It was not unusual for our quarters to be
fired into at night.</p>

<p>&#8220;The place being exposed to the cold wintry winds
from Lake Erie we suffered from the intense cold,
and in summer the only shade was that afforded by the
buildings where the prisoners were housed.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></p>

<p><i>Thursday, April 2.</i>&mdash;The soldiers here have to endure
greater hardships than we do. Last night they
were coughing continually in the barracks adjoining
the quarters I am in. One poor fellow, suffering with
neuralgia, was walking up and down the floor, groaning
and acting like a crazy man. At last, losing his
patience completely, he commenced to swear. A comrade,
shocked at his utterances, said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>&#8220;Bill, why don&#8217;t you pray to God to help you,
instead of cursing and going on as you are?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; replied Bill, &#8220;I have done that, but d&mdash;&mdash;n
it, He won&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Cannon told Bowles yesterday that he had
written to Colonel French the day before, to know
what he should do with the citizens brought here.
This should have been provided for in advance of their
arrival. There seems to be very poor management on
the part of the officials in charge.</p>

<p>Yesterday we got a ration of flour and half a ration
of bacon&mdash;quarter of a pound to each man.</p>

<p>This afternoon nine hundred men arrived from
Camp Chase. There is now a general exchange going
on, and it is said about six thousand prisoners are to
be brought on. A number were sent off to-day. They
go to the Western army. The wind is blowing very hard.
Frank Fox, Phil. Lee, and the two Mills sick. Militia
relieved from guard duty.</p>

<p>Barnes yesterday appointed sergeant of our company.
This morning some of our mess bought a bottle
of brandy and half a gallon of beans. I had a good
drink of the brandy, and it put a little warmth in me.
Beans for dinner&mdash;the first good hearty meal since we
left the Old Capitol.</p>

<p>We borrowed a big iron kettle from one of the
messes, and having gathered a lot of wood and chips,
started a fire and put our beans on to cook. One of
the men picked up a piece of an old cracker box and
we made a number of rude paddles to use as spoons
in eating the beans. Tom Lee was walking around
seemingly unconscious of what was going on. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
say anything to Tom about what we are doing,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
one. Tom wandered off, and when he returned the
beans were ready for eating.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you going to eat the beans&mdash;with your
fingers?&#8221; asked Tom as he saw us seat ourselves
around the pot.</p>

<p>All smiled at his innocence, and taking out their
paddles commenced fishing for beans. Tom quietly
took from his pocket a clam shell he had found in his
wanderings and fitted it into a split stick. With this
primitive but all-sufficient implement he proceeded to
dip into the pot, and while the beans were slipping off
our rudely fashioned paddles he could scoop up at one
dip as much as we could take at a dozen.</p>

<p>&#8220;You boys are smart,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;but you couldn&#8217;t
fool your brother Tom.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Saturday, April 4.</i>&mdash;Got a pass to visit Petersburg
in company with Jack Barnes, Gus Williams and Tom
Lee.</p>

<p>Our rations are dealt out in such homeopathic doses
that we are always glad when we can obtain a pass
to visit Petersburg so as to gratify a little of that
craving for food which it is impossible to satisfy here.</p>

<p>Went through the market. Meat selling at $1 a
pound; turnips, 25 cents each, and other vegetables in
proportion. Bought a hat, $20; had a drink of apple
brandy, 50 cents. Walked up along the Appomattox
River, and came back into camp through the old
Fair Grounds. Rain and cold wind; nearly all the
tents blown down.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, April 5.</i>&mdash;Still raining. Captain Cannon
said a dispatch had been received from the Secretary
of War, that all civilians not attached to regular commands
and liable to conscription, would have the privilege<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
of joining any command they chose. I told Cannon
I was a Marylander and that I would like to go to
Richmond before making choice. He said I must first
designate a command I wished to join. Told him then
I would join Captain Mosby. He said I would be
mustered in and leave as soon as possible.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, April 7.</i>&mdash;Went to Petersburg with Barnes,
Wrenn and Biggins. Got plate of ham and eggs (two
eggs and a piece of bacon), $1.25.</p>

<p>George Richardson, Gus Williams, Cooke, J. Mills
and Benjamin F. Bowles left camp and went to Richmond.
Williams, in bidding us good-bye, said he expected
to be back in the Old Capitol within a week
after leaving Richmond. He said this was the fourth
time he had been a prisoner; that his two daughters
and one son, about ten or twelve years of age, were
arrested at the instigation of Union men and imprisoned
three months.</p>

<p>Some of the Confederate officers from the Old
Capitol Prison came down last night and reported at
camp this morning: Captain Sherman, Major Breckenridge,
Lieutenants Smith, Bixler and others. William
M. Mills leaves camp to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, April 9.</i>&mdash;One of the prisoners from
Camp Douglas told me that there was great mortality
among the Confederate prisoners there. A large number
were in the hospital, and the morning he left there
were thirty corpses in the dead house. &#8220;It is no
wonder they die off,&#8221; said he; &#8220;hundreds were frost-bitten
and suffered terribly from the cold last winter.
Fuel was given out so sparingly, that we had to
treasure every little piece of wood and coal as if it
was precious metal we were hoarding. Our rations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
were cut down so that we were never able to satisfy
the craving of hunger. So long as we were allowed to
receive food from benevolent persons outside of the
prison some of the prisoners fared tolerably well, but
when the order came prohibiting this we really suffered.
Many poor fellows, broken down and emaciated
by disease, passed away in the silence of the night and
their companions in misery were in ignorance of the
fact until the dawning of day exposed to their view
the pale corpse in their midst.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our barracks were miserable, dilapidated buildings,
and our prison guards were brutal in the extreme;
they had never been to the front, nor within sight or
sound of a battle. Kicks and curses were liberally
dealt out, and prisoners were shot without any real
provocation. Men were hung up by the thumbs until
they fainted. One half-starved prisoner was shot
while fishing bones out of a slop-barrel.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Sunday, April 12.</i>&mdash;Fine day. Yesterday I was passed
out by Lieutenant Smith. Gathered some broom-sage
and made a bed of it, so I slept more comfortably
last night. Heavy cannonading heard yesterday.</p>

<p>About four o&#8217;clock this afternoon I was regularly
mustered into the Confederate service, to serve under
Mosby, now operating in the borderland of Virginia.</p>

<p>Lindsay, of Washington, went to Richmond, to be
sent to Company K, Tenth Louisiana Regiment.</p>

<p>There have been so many prisoners brought here to
Camp Parole lately that we are getting overcrowded.
Coming from the prison pens of Camp Chase, Camp
Douglas, Johnson&#8217;s Island, and other Northern prisons,
where they have been confined for months, they are all
more or less infested with vermin. It is a common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
sight to see an old soldier quietly seat himself in a
line of unfortunates, on the sunny side of a fence or
building sheltered from the cold wind, and deliberately
drawing his shirt over his head, set to work industriously
searching for vampires&mdash;picking them out
from their hiding places in the folds and creases.
Skirmishing, the boys term this occupation, though it
might be called picketing. To kill the tiny creatures
who seek to conceal themselves along the seams of
the pants, and to destroy the eggs, two round stones
are taken in the hands, and by clapping them together
up and down the seams on the side of the legs of the
pants the life is crushed out of a goodly number of the
bloodthirsty crew.</p>

<p>Expecting now to leave the camp in a day or two,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
we&mdash;that is, our mess (and we certainly were a sorry
mess)&mdash;went up the Appomattox to Elk Licking Creek
and took a bath. We had gotten so stocked up with
vermin, that the only way we could see to rid ourselves
of the pest was to buy new outfits in Petersburg
and go to the Creek, take a good scrubbing, throw
away all our old clothes and put on the new ones.</p>

<p><i>Monday, April 13.</i>&mdash;William McK. Perry, who was
a room-mate in the Old Capitol Prison, sent there from
Camp Chase, left Parole Camp to-day for his home in

Along the road to Richmond are lines of rifle pits
and intrenchments commanding the approaches to
the city. When we reached the outposts at Richmond
we were challenged by a guard, and after showing
our papers, were permitted to proceed to the hotel.
We put up at the Powhatan House, corner of Eleventh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
and Broad Streets. Our supper consisted of tough
beef, bread and rye coffee&mdash;no butter.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, April 15.</i>&mdash;Settled my bill at the Powhatan,

<p class="caption">LIEUTENANT FRANK FOX</p>

<p><i>Thursday, April 16.</i>&mdash;At 7:30 left Richmond and
arrived at Gordonsville at 1 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>; stopped at Mann&#8217;s
Hotel. Gordonsville is a miserable looking place now.
There has been so much rain lately, and the roads have
been cut up with the travel and passing of army teams
and trains, so that it is little else than a mud-hole.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span><i>Saturday, April 18.</i>&mdash;Paid Mann&#8217;s bill, $7.50. There
are but six of us now, as Frank Fox left us and remained
at Barboursville. MacWooster hitched up a
wagon, agreeing to take us to Madison Court House
for $5 each. We reached Madison Court House about
dark and went to a hotel kept by Mr. Seal. Here
we were very comfortable&mdash;good beds and an excellent
table.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, April 19.</i>&mdash;Madison Court House is a very
pretty little place, well situated, and commanding a
beautiful view of the Blue Ridge and surrounding
country. There are two or three churches and a fine
court house. The houses are neat and comfortable.
After dinner paid Mr. Seal. Our bill for supper,
breakfast and dinner, was $4.50.</p>

<p>MacWooster said he would carry us as far as Criglersville,
about six miles distant, and there leave us to
foot it. The drive along the road was very pleasant,
particularly after striking Robertson River, a beautiful
clear stream with a swift current, which comes down
from the mountains.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, boys,&#8221; said Mac, as he bid us good-bye at a
ford on the Robertson River, &#8220;you&#8217;ve got a rough
road before you, and a poor country to travel through.
Take my advice and stop for the night at Matt.
Graves&#8217;s. His house is near the foot of the mountain.
He is one of the finest men in the country. He will
treat you well and give you the best he has in his
house.&#8221; We afterward found good reason to be thankful
for having taken this friendly advice.</p>

<p>When we reached the house which we supposed was
to be our haven of rest, we saw a man riding up to the
stable, and on accosting him found he was Mr. Graves.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
He invited us to his house, where he regaled us with a
good drink and a bottle for our day&#8217;s journey on the
morrow. This he said we would find needful before
we got far on our road, for he not only repeated
MacWooster&#8217;s warning as to the hardships awaiting
us, but also said he feared the weather would prove
unfavorable and add to our discomfort.</p>

<p><i>Monday, April 20.</i>&mdash;At Mr. Graves&#8217;s there is a little
fellow about the size, age and appearance of my
youngest son, Bernardin. Seeing him playing around
and fondling on his father it brought to mind thoughts
of home&mdash;thoughts of home and its comforts; of the
dear ones there; of the sad hearts I left, and of the
glad hearts to greet me on my return. I could hardly
resist the temptation to pick up the little one without
saying a word, but I feared he would cry, so I made
friends with him by showing him a ring on my finger,
and so coaxed him on until I had banished any fears
he might have. All the time I was there I could
scarcely keep my eyes off him.</p>

<p>Paid Mr. Graves $2 each for supper, bed and breakfast,
and started to cross the mountain at Milani&#8217;s
Gap. We were told it was ten miles from Mr. Graves&#8217;s
to the top of the ridge and six miles to the foot on
the other side. Rain set in last night and this morning
the clouds are very heavy, enveloping the mountains
completely. The road takes a zigzag course up
the slope, which is quite steep in many places. A great
portion of the way we followed along the Robertson
River. The scenery, as well as we could see it through
the mist, appeared grand. It was mountains piled on
mountains&mdash;an ocean of ridges. In some places we
could travel for a long distance and then throw a stone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
to the place we started from. A number of huts are
scattered through this mountain region, but the people
are almost as wild as Indians, and it was impossible
to obtain refreshments of any kind along the road.</p>

<p>When about four miles from the top rain again set
in, and we tramped along through the driving storm.
In some places, endeavoring to save distance, we
would leave the main road and climb up the steep sides
until we struck into the road at some point higher up.
We had to ford the swift mountain streams, or
cross on an old log or fallen tree, where, as also
in clambering along the narrow footpath, a false step,
the turning of a stone or the breaking of a limb, and
one would have been precipitated into the foaming
current which dashed on among the rocks. In those
mountain storms a tiny stream which winds along like
a silvery thread in fair weather, is in less than an
hour transformed into a raging torrent, sweeping off
everything in its course.</p>

<p>On nearing the top we fell in with a man who was
traveling through the country buying up cattle and
forage for the Confederate Government. He kept in
company with us until we reached Marksville. Hearing
a noise which sounded like the rumbling of a
wagon train coming down the road, we listened and
finally concluded it either proceeded from a subterranean
stream which flowed through the mountains
or that roaring which usually precedes a mountain
storm.</p>

<p>Seeing a hut near the roadside, we stopped, and a
youth came out to the fence, followed by a squad of
unkempt redheaded children. We asked if we could
get anything to eat. He had nothing. Seeing some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
chickens roaming around, Barnes said he would give
him $1.50 for a dozen eggs. He replied that he had
none; no meal&mdash;nothing edible, and it was a half mile
to the top of the mountain.</p>

<p>We passed through Dismal Hollow, a wild, romantic-looking
place. The road was sometimes hidden by
the overhanging foliage. We saw the snow piled up
on the side of the road and through the hemlock
thickets, where it remains far into the summer. On
reaching the top of the mountain we uncorked our
bottle and drank that the Yankees might never cross
the Blue Ridge.</p>

<p>Then commenced our descent, and it is hard to say
whether it was easier to go up or down hill. Had it
not been for the rain our traveling would have been
less difficult. After getting to the foot we proceeded
on until we came to the house of a man named Kite.
He had a fine house and farm, but refused to accommodate
us. He said he was eaten out and had
not enough for his own family. We jogged on through
the rain until we reached Marksville, on the Hawksbill
Creek, where we stopped a few minutes to rest,
and then walked along until within about four miles of
Luray.</p>

<p>We inquired at every house along the road, but could
neither get a mouthful to eat nor a place to shelter us
from the rain, though we told them all we were not
asking charity, but were willing to pay liberally for all
we received. After so many rebuffs we were about
giving up the attempt to get food or shelter, when
Barnes and Wrenn stopped at the house of Reuben
Long. He said he would take three of us and the
other three could get accommodated at the next house&mdash;a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
Mr. Spitter. We tried there and he had a sick
family. We then went to the house of Ambrose Varner,
who received us kindly, built a big fire to warm
us and dry our wet clothes, and prepared a good substantial
supper for us. Charles Ratcliffe had become
disgusted with our receptions and made arrangements
to build a fire and pass the night in an old shanty,
while a negro was to furnish bread and meat for his
supper. He afterward came to Varner&#8217;s, where we
spent the night.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, April 21.</i>&mdash;After a good breakfast we prepared
for a start. On asking what our bill was, Mr.
Varner said he would make no charge, but if we chose
to give his wife anything for her trouble, he would
leave it altogether with us. We gave him $2 each,
and he put up a nice lunch to take along with us. We
called at Long&#8217;s, where Barnes and Wrenn joined us,
and then pushed on to Luray. Yesterday we walked
a little more than twenty-one miles across the mountains,
through mud and rain.</p>

<p>At Luray, while Barnes and Wrenn stopped at
Modisett&#8217;s Hotel for dinner, I went in search of a
druggist, as I had been unwell for several days. He
gave me some powders. I took one, which made me
very sick. I lay down for a while, but felt no better,
and we started off on the road to Front Royal. Along
the road I was burning with fever&mdash;my head so dizzy
that I staggered like a person drunk. I had an excessive
thirst and drank at every spring or stream we
came to, but even water would not remain on my
stomach&mdash;soon after drinking I would be taken with
vomiting. After going about six miles we turned off
from the road into a lane, and thence to the house of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
Mr. Hoffman, where we obtained supper, bed and
breakfast. The good lady of the house made me a cup
of tea, which I drank, but could eat no supper. Went
to bed early, and after I got in bed Mr. Hoffman
brought me a glass of toddy.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, April 22.</i>&mdash;Felt somewhat better this
morning; got breakfast. Settled bill, $1 each. Mr.
Hoffman brought us a plate of biscuits to carry along
and we started for Front Royal. We met parties along
the route, each with a different story to tell about the
approach of the Yankees. Some said they were in
force at Middletown, about 12 miles from Front Royal.
Others, that they were expected in Front Royal at
any moment, and advising us not to stop there. Indeed,
had we heeded half the reports we would have
retraced our steps.</p>

<p>A few miles from Front Royal we met a carriage
going toward Luray. In it was a young man in
Confederate uniform and two young ladies. Barnes
spoke to them and one immediately recognized him.
She was Miss Belle Ford, a cousin to Miss Antonia
Ford, who was arrested and confined in the Old Capitol
Prison after Mosby&#8217;s raid into Fairfax Court
House and capture of General Stoughton, charged
with giving Mosby information which led to the raid
and capture.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> After leaving them we proceeded about
another mile, when we were halted by a patrol of
Confederate Cavalry, who demanded to know where
we were from, where we were going, etc. One of them
said he had seen the Yankees at Middletown&mdash;cavalry,
infantry and artillery&mdash;and cautioned us about stopping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
at Front Royal. Our road ran a great distance along
the Shenandoah River. On the one side we had the
river banks, and on the other towering rocks and
rugged mountains. In some places there was a gradual
slope, while in others they rose perpendicular, forming
a complete wall, but without its uniformity&mdash;massive
and broken, showing occasionally large fissures which,
viewed from the ground, resembled windows.</p>

<p class="caption">BRIGADIER-GENERAL EDWIN H. STOUGHTON, U. S. A.</p>

<p>On reaching Front Royal we went to the hotel.
There are two in town, but only one occupied. Here
a very nice supper was set out for us, but I was content
with a dish of boiled milk. There were but two
beds in the house, and as there were six of us we slept
three in a bed.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, April 23.</i>&mdash;Good breakfast this morning.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
It was raining very hard when we started on toward
Markham. Our route led us down the old Manassas
Railroad. The track had been torn up, the sleepers
and all woodwork burnt, the rails bent and in many
cases twisted around the trunks of trees. The road
in some places was so muddy we sunk five or six
inches at every step, and in other places we were slipping
over sharp broken stones. Finding the road so
bad, our clothing completely saturated with rain, and
there being no appearance of the rain ceasing, we
halted by the roadside at an old deserted shanty, which
had at one time been occupied by workmen on the railroad.
We gathered some wood, built a fire and tried
to make ourselves as comfortable as possible. We
bought seven pounds of flour from an old Irishman
living near by, but could get neither meat nor eggs.
The man baked us some bread and with it brought us a
pot of coffee. At night slept on a bunch of wet straw
thrown on the floor of the shanty&mdash;that is, on the place
where the flooring should be, but in this instance it
was dirt, the same as outside, except that it was
sheltered from the rain.</p>

<p><i>Friday, April 24.</i>&mdash;Still raining. Made another
start, but stopped at Mr. Lee&#8217;s, about a mile from our
last halting place, and got breakfast. We then struck
out through rain and mud, our boots soaking wet and
our clothes hanging limp. Stopped at Bush Thompson&#8217;s
and bought some apple brandy. Passed through
Markham and on to Piedmont (now called Delaplane).
We crossed Goose Creek three times: first, on charred
logs, the remains of what was once the railroad bridge;
second, on a fallen tree, and, third, on a bridge similar
to the first. The burnt logs, broken and bent down,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
looked as if ready to give way under our weight in
crossing. From Piedmont took the road to Upperville,
where we arrived early in the evening. Barnes and
Ratcliffe went to the house of a friend near town.
Philip Lee, Thomas Lee, Wrenn and myself went to
Lunchford&#8217;s, where we got a very poor supper,
no fire, and sat until bedtime shivering in our wet boots
and clothes.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, April 25.</i>&mdash;On opening my valise to get
out dry clothes, I was surprised to find that the water
had leaked in and everything in it was soaked with
water. I was compelled to put on wet socks and underclothes.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_118.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">CERTIFICATE OF MEMBERSHIP</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="caption">As there were men wearing Confederate uniforms (either deserters
or absent from their commands without leave), roaming about the
country, claiming to belong to Mosby&#8217;s command, the men were furnished
with certificates of this kind.</p>
</div>


<p>There was a meeting of Mosby&#8217;s men in Upperville
on this day and they were coming in town singly and
in small squads from different directions. I saw Mosby
and made myself known to him and my purpose in
coming to Virginia. He said he would furnish me a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
horse, and told me to come to the next meeting of the
command.</p>

<p>I met a number of men who had been prisoners in
the Old Capitol with me. I was introduced to William
Ayre and rode with him to the home of his brother
George S. Ayre, at Ayreshire, who had been a room-mate
with me in the Old Capitol Prison. He welcomed
me to his home and told me to make his house my headquarters.
When I got my horse and equipments I
was ready to enter upon my career as a Partisan
Ranger.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TREATMENT OF PRISONERS OF WAR</h2>
</div>


<p>Hon. Jefferson Davis, in a letter written from
Beauvoir, December, 1888, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Nearly a quarter of a century has elapsed since war
between the States ceased. Has the prejudice fed on
the passions of that period ceased with the physical
strife? Shall it descend from sire to son, hardened by
its transmission? Or shall it be destroyed by the full
development of the truth, the exposure of the guilty,
and the vindication of the innocent?&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>In the North a general impression was produced,
and exists to a certain extent even at this late day, that
Northern prisoners incarcerated in Southern prisons
during the war, were brutally treated, starved, frozen,
neglected and inhumanly treated in sickness, and even
murdered, and that this was done in accordance with
a wilful and deliberate plan, inaugurated by the Confederate
Government and carried out by its officers
and soldiers. And no other subject has tended more to
keep alive a bitter and hostile feeling between the
sections.</p>

<p>It is not so much among soldiers who fought
through the war that the intenseness of this feeling is
shown as among those whose fighting has been done
since the war. In most cases it is the result of prejudice
or through ignorance of the real facts.</p>

<p>The Confederate authorities made every effort possible
to alleviate the sufferings of prisoners in Southern
prisons. Finding it impossible to effect exchange man
for man, and aware of their inability to properly care<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
for the sick and wounded, they offered to deliver to
the United States authorities the sick and wounded
without insisting on the delivery of any equivalent in
return. It was nearly four months after this offer
was made by the Confederate authorities before it was
accepted by the United States authorities, who had
been informed of the frightful mortality among their
soldiers in Southern prisons and urged to send speedy
transportation to take them away.</p>

<p>Robert Ould, Confederate Agent of Exchange, offered
to purchase medicines from the United States
authorities, to be used exclusively for the relief of
United States prisoners&mdash;to pay in gold, cotton or
tobacco&mdash;two or three prices even&mdash;such medicines to
be brought into the Confederate lines and dispensed
by United States surgeons.</p>

<p>The following letter will show the persistent efforts
made by the Confederate authorities for the relief of
prisoners in their hands:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">Confederate States of America,<br />
War Department, Richmond, Va., Jan. 24, 1864.</p>

<p>Major-General <span class="smcap">E. A. Hitchcock</span>,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Agent of Exchange</i>.</p>

<p>Sir:&mdash;In view of the present difficulties attending
the exchange and release of prisoners, I propose that
all such on each side shall be attended by a proper
number of their own surgeons, who, under rules to be
established, shall be permitted to take charge of their
health and comfort.</p>

<p>I also propose that these surgeons shall act as commissaries,
with power to receive and distribute such
contributions of money, food, clothing and medicines
as may be forwarded for the relief of prisoners. I
further propose that these surgeons be selected by their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
own governments, and that they shall have full liberty
at any and all times, through the agents of exchange,
to make reports not only of their own acts, but of any
matters relating to the welfare of the prisoners.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Respectfully, your obedient servant,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Ro. Ould</span>, <i>Agent of Exchange</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Could anything be fairer and more humane than this
proposal?</p>

<p>In a letter to the editor of the <i>National Intelligencer</i>,
dated August 17, 1868, Robert Ould says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The cartel of exchange bears date July 22, 1862.
The fourth article provided that all prisoners of war
should be discharged on parole in ten days after capture.
From the date of the cartel until the summer of
1863, the Confederate authorities had the excess of
prisoners. During that interval deliveries were made
as fast as the Federal Government furnished transportation....
As long as the Confederate
Government had the excess of prisoners matters went
on smoothly enough; but as soon as the posture of
affairs in that respect was changed the cartel could
no longer be observed.</p>

<p>&#8220;More than once I urged the mortality at Andersonville
as a reason for haste on the part of the United
States authorities. I know personally it was the purpose
of the Confederate Government to send off from
its prisons all the sick and wounded, and to continue
to do the same from time to time, without requiring
any equivalents.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>The War Department at Washington, on July 3,
1863, issued General Order No. 209, which states that
&#8220;it is understood captured officers and men and sick
and wounded in hospitals have been paroled and released,&#8221;
and concludes: &#8220;Any officer or soldier who
gives such parole will be returned to duty without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
exchange, and, moreover, will be punished for disobedience
to orders.&#8221;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>General J. A. Early, commenting on this order,
said: &#8220;But for that order all the prisoners captured
by us at Gettysburg, amounting to fully six thousand,
would have been paroled, and, in fact, the proper staff
officers were proceeding to parole them, and had
actually paroled and released a large number of them,
when news came of the order referred to. Why did
Mr. Stanton object to the paroling of those prisoners?
And why did he prefer that they should be confined
in prisons in the South&mdash;&#8216;prison pens,&#8217; as Northern
Republicans are pleased to call them.... If any
of the prisoners brought from Gettysburg, or subsequently
captured, lost their lives at Andersonville, or
any other Southern prison, is it not palpable that the
responsibility for their deaths rested on Edwin M.
Stanton?&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>The fact is, the authorities at Washington were
willing to allow their soldiers to languish and die in
Southern prisons rather than consent to exchange.
Would rather have them kept and starved that they
might make capital out of it. When they consented
to receive the sick and wounded, they did it&mdash;not for
the purpose of ameliorating their sufferings, but that
they might take the worst looking of the sick and
starved prisoners and make an exhibition of their pictures
to arouse a feeling of resentment among the
Northern people, cover up their own infamy and place
the South in a false light before the powers of the
world.</p>

<p>In August, 1864, Brigadier-Generals Wessells and
Seymour were sent South to look into the condition
and treatment of Union prisoners. From a report of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
General Seymour to Colonel Hoffman, Commissary-General
of Prisoners, Washington, D. C., I take the
following extract, which proves how little the United
States authorities were concerned on account of the
sufferings of their soldiers who were held as prisoners
of war:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The Southern authorities are exceedingly desirous
of an exchange of prisoners. General Wessells and
myself had an interview with General Ripley at
Charleston, S. C., on this point. Their urgency is unbounded,
but we asserted that it was the poorest possible
policy for our Government to deliver to them
40,000 prisoners, better fed and clothed than ever before
in their lives, in good condition for the field, while
the United States receives in return an equal number
of men worn out with privations and neglect, barely
able to walk, often drawing their last breath, and
utterly unfit to take the field as soldiers.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Major-General Ben Butler, referring to the frustration
of his efforts, while in command at Fortress
Monroe, to bring about an exchange of prisoners, says
in his book:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;His (Grant&#8217;s) proposition was to make an aggressive
fight upon Lee, trusting to the superiority of
numbers and to the practical impossibility of Lee getting
any considerable reinforcements to keep up his
army. We had 26,000 Confederate prisoners, and if
they were exchanged it would give the Confederates a
corps larger than any in Lee&#8217;s army, of disciplined
veterans, better able to stand the hardships of a campaign
and more capable than any other,&#8221; etc.</p>
</div>

<p>At the last session of the Confederate Congress a
joint committee of the two Houses was appointed to
take up and investigate the &#8220;Condition and Treatment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
of Prisoners of War.&#8221; This committee took a vast
amount of testimony&mdash;sworn depositions of witnesses&mdash;surgeons,
officers and soldiers, private citizens and
Federal prisoners.</p>

<p>The object of this was to correct the unjust statements
and misrepresentations which were circulated,
and to remove false impressions and unfounded prejudices&mdash;to
present to the world &#8220;a vindication of their
country and relieve her authorities from the injurious
slanders brought against her by her enemies.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the extremely lengthy Report of this committee
I give here a few extracts:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;This Report is rendered especially important by
reason of persistent efforts lately made by the Government
of the United States and by associations and individuals
connected or co-operating with it, to asperse
the honor of the Confederate authorities and to charge
them with deliberate and wilful cruelty to prisoners of
war. Two publications have been issued at the North
within the past year and have been circulated not only
in the United States but in some parts of the South
and in Europe. One of these is the Report of the joint
select committee of the Northern Congress on the Conduct
of the War, known as &#8216;Report No. 67.&#8217; It is accompanied
by eight pictures or photographs alleged to
represent United States prisoners of war returned from
Richmond in a sad state of emaciation and suffering.</p>

<p>&#8220;The intent and spirit of this report may be gathered
from the following extract: &#8216;The evidence proves
beyond all manner of doubt, a determination on the part
of the rebel authorities, deliberately and persistently
practised for a long time past, to subject those of our
soldiers who have been so unfortunate as to fall into
their hands to a system of treatment which has resulted
in reducing many of those who have survived and
been permitted to return to us to a condition both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
physically and mentally which no language we can
use can adequately describe.&#8217;&mdash;Rep. p. 1.</p>

<p>&#8220;The other (Report) purports to be a &#8216;Narrative of
the Privations and Sufferings of United States Officers
and Soldiers while Prisoners of War,&#8217; and is
issued as a Report of a Commission of Inquiry appointed
by the United States Sanitary Commission.</p>

<p>&#8220;The disingenuous attempt is made in both these
publications to produce the impression that these sick
and emaciated men were fair representatives of the
general state of the prisoners held by the South, and
that all their prisoners were being rapidly reduced to
the same state by starvation and cruelty, and by neglect,
ill-treatment and denial of proper food, stimulants and
medicines in the Confederate hospitals. The facts are
simply these:</p>


<p>&#8220;The Federal authorities, in violation of the cartel,
having for a long time refused exchange of prisoners,
finally consented to a partial exchange of the sick
and wounded on both sides. Accordingly a number of
such prisoners were sent from the hospitals in Richmond.
General directions had been given that none
should be sent, except those who might be expected to
endure the removal and passage with safety to their
lives; but in some cases the surgeons were induced to
depart from this rule by the entreaties of some officers
and men in the last stages of emaciation, suffering not
only with excessive debility, but with &#8216;nostalgia,&#8217; or
home-sickness, whose cases were regarded as desperate,
who could not live if they remained, and might
possibly improve if carried home. Thus it happened
that some very sick and emaciated men were carried
to Annapolis, but their illness was not the result of
ill-treatment or neglect. Such cases might be found
in any large hospital North or South. They might
even be found in private families, where the sufferer
would be surrounded by every comfort that love could
bestow. Yet these are the cases which, with hideous
violation of decency, the Northern Committee have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
paraded in pictures and photographs. They have taken
their own sick and enfeebled soldiers, have stripped
them naked; have exposed them before a daguerrean
apparatus, have pictured every shrunken limb and
muscle, and all for the purpose, not of relieving their
sufferings, but of bringing a false and slanderous
charge against the South.</p>

<p>&#8220;A candid reader of these publications will not fail
to discover that, whether the statements they make
be true or not, their spirit is not adapted to promote
a better feeling between the hostile powers. They are
not intended for the humane purpose of ameliorating
the condition of the unhappy prisoners held in captivity.
They are designed to inflame the evil passions
of the North; to keep up the war spirit among their
own people; to represent the South as acting under
the dominion of a spirit of cruelty, inhumanity and
interested malice, and thus to vilify her people in the
eyes of all on whom these publications can work.</p>

<p>&#8220;But even now enough is known to vindicate the
South, and to furnish an overwhelming answer to all
complaints on the part of the United States Government
or people, that their prisoners were stinted in
food or supplies. Their own savage warfare has
wrought the evil. They have blockaded our ports;
have excluded from us food, clothing and medicines;
have even declared medicines contraband of war, and
have repeatedly destroyed the contents of drug stores,
and the supplies of private physicians in the country;
have ravaged our country, burned our houses and destroyed
growing crops and farming implements. One
of their officers&mdash;(General Sheridan)&mdash;has boasted in
his official report that in the Shenandoah Valley alone
he burned 2,000 barns filled with wheat and corn; that
he burned all the mills in the whole tract of country,
destroyed all the factories of cloth, and killed or drove
off every animal, even to the poultry, that could contribute
to human sustenance. These desolations have
been repeated again and again in different parts of the
South. Thousands of our families have been driven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
from their homes, as helpless and destitute refugees.
Our enemies have destroyed our railroads and other
means of transportation, by which food could be supplied
from abundant districts to those without it.
While thus desolating our country in violation of the
usages of civilized warfare, they have refused to exchange
prisoners; have forced us to keep 50,000 of
their men in captivity, and yet have attempted to attribute
to us the sufferings and privations caused by
their own acts.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>The report also contains a great amount of testimony
concerning the cruel treatment of Confederate
prisoners in Northern prisons.</p>

<p>Pollard, in his history of the &#8220;Lost Cause,&#8221; after
reciting the extraordinary efforts made by the Confederate
authorities to relieve the sufferings at Andersonville,
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Who was responsible for the sufferings of the sick
and wounded prisoners at Andersonville, from August
to December, 1864? The world will ask with amazement
if it was possible that thousands of prisoners
were left to die in inadequate places of confinement,
merely to make a case against the South&mdash;merely for
romance! The simple fact gives the clue to the whole
story of the deception and inhuman cruelty of the
authorities at Washington with reference to their
prisoners of war&mdash;the key to a chapter of horrors that
even the hardy hand of history shakes to unlock. To
blacken the reputation of an honorable enemy; to make
a false appeal to the sensibilities of the world; to
gratify an inhuman revenge, Mr. Stanton, the saturnine
and malignant Secretary of War at Washington,
did not hesitate to doom to death thousands of his
countrymen, and then to smear their sentinels with accusing
blood.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span></p>


<h3>ABOUT DEAD-LINES</h3>

<p>Much has been written and spoken of the &#8220;dead-lines&#8221;
in Southern prisons. One would suppose they
were unknown in Northern prisons. The fact is, they
were as common at the North as in the South. There
was not a Northern prison-camp but had its &#8220;dead-line,&#8221;
and at all these prisons men were shot at and
many killed <i>for passing over them</i>. And there was
no reason to complain of this, for the lines were
plainly marked, and it was known that anyone attempting
to cross them would be shot. So, any man&mdash;no
matter whether North or South&mdash;killed in violating
this regulation did not deserve any sympathy.</p>

<p>Even in the Old Capitol Prison guards with loaded
guns were stationed around the prison, within and
without, and any prisoner attempting to escape, or
overstepping the bounds, was liable to be shot. Two
men, at least, were killed there&mdash;Wharton and Stewart,
as described in my Prison Diary, page 36. And this in
the city of Washington, a fortified city, within the
Union lines, surrounded by camps, with thousands of
soldiers, and the prisoners confined in a walled prison-house
heavily guarded.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">MAJOR HENRY WIRZ, C. S. A.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center"><i>The True History of the Wirz Case.</i></p>


<p>I was living in Washington at the time Captain
Wirz underwent the travesty of a trial&mdash;a farce which
ended in a tragedy.</p>

<p>I frequently met and conversed with Louis Schade,
his counsel, and his associate, Judge Hughes. I also
met and conversed with witnesses on the trial.</p>

<p>Rev. Father Boyle and Father Wiget, who attended
Wirz during his imprisonment and ministered to him
in his last moments on the scaffold, were both warm
personal friends of mine&mdash;Father Wiget particularly.
I not only regarded him as a spiritual father, as he
was, but with all the respect and affection which a
devoted son would have for a kind, loving father.
Had I any doubts in the matter of the guilt or innocence
of Wirz, I would take the word of either of these
good and true men before that of the whole tribe of
hired perjurers who testified against him.</p>

<p>There are many persons at the present day who
know nothing as to the truth or falsity of the record
of events which took place during and immediately
after the Civil War, except what they have heard or
perhaps read in histories written in the heat of passion,
with prejudice and malice, and their minds are
often poisoned and their judgments warped by the
misrepresentations and sensational stories invented at
the time to exasperate the people of the North.</p>

<p>Major Henry Wirz was a native of Switzerland.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
He came to this country, and in 1861 was a physician
practising his profession in Western Louisiana.</p>

<p>He entered the Confederate Army at the beginning
of the war, was wounded&mdash;his right arm
shattered by a ball, so that he remained a cripple permanently.
As his right arm was powerless he did not
have the physical ability to ill-treat prisoners as some
of the witnesses testified at his trial. Even if this
charge had been true, that he exercised undue severity
toward some of the prisoners, he might have been
justified in so doing, when their fellow-prisoners were
compelled to hang a half a dozen in self-defense.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_133.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">MAJOR HENRY WIRZ, C. S. A.</p>

<p>In 1862 he was promoted to the rank of Captain
&#8220;for bravery on the field of battle,&#8221; and to that of
Major a few months before the close of the war.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>He was an impulsive man&mdash;some said he was rough
in his manner. This apparent roughness in persons of
foreign birth sometimes proceeds from difference in
language and their mode of expression, which may
only need a little prejudice or ill-will to distort into
something offensive. But that he was a man kind at
heart is shown by his earnest endeavors to relieve the
sufferings of the prisoners under his charge.</p>

<p>In the Official Records of the Rebellion, published
by the United States Government, will be found letters
of Wirz to Captain R. D. Chapman, Acting Adjutant
of Post, and Colonel D. S. Chandler, Assistant
Adjutant and Inspector-General, showing his efforts
to better the condition of the prisoners, both with regard
to rations and hygiene.</p>

<p>In the Southern Historical Society Papers is a
letter from General John D. Imboden, written in 1876,
from which the following extracts are taken:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I have already alluded to Captain Wirz&#8217;s recommendation
to put up more shelter. I ordered it, and
thereafter, daily, a hundred or more prisoners were
paroled and set to work in the neighboring forest.
In the course of a fortnight comfortable log-houses,
with floors and good chimneys&mdash;for which the
prisoners made and burnt the brick&mdash;were erected for
twelve or fifteen hundred men.</p>

<p>&#8220;This same man (Captain Wirz) who was tried
and hung as a murderer, warmly urged the establishment
of a tannery and shoemaker&#8217;s shop, informing
me that there were many men among the prisoners
skilled in these trades, and that some of them knew
a process of very rapidly converting hides into
tolerably good leather. There were thousands of hides
at Andersonville from the young cattle butchered during
the previous summer and fall, whilst the country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
yet contained such animals. A few weeks later many
of the barefooted prisoners were supplied with rough,
but comfortable shoes. Another suggestion came from
the medical staff of the post, that I ordered to be
at once put into practice: It was to brew corn beer
for those suffering from scorbutic taint. Captain Wirz
entered warmly into this enterprise. I mention these
facts to show that he was not the monster he was
afterward represented to be, when his blood was called
for by infuriated fanaticism. I would have proved
these facts <i>if I had been permitted to testify on his
trial, after I was summoned before the Court by the
United States</i>, and have substantiated them by the
records of the prison and of my own headquarters.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>When the Federal troops were sent to Georgia
Major Wirz was placed under guard and taken to
the Old Capitol Prison, in Washington, D. C., where
he remained from the 10th of May, 1865, until November
10th, 1865, when he was hung.</p>

<p>For three weary months he was kept a close
prisoner, and then he was taken before a Military
Commission for trial (?).</p>

<p>In the case of Major Wirz the usual course of procedure
was reversed&mdash;he was first condemned, then
tried, and finally executed. Yet this was not the final
act, for the malignity of his persecutors followed him
even after death. When Father Boyle and others
sought to give the body of Wirz Christian burial in
consecrated ground the request was denied and the
body deposited beside those executed for the assassination
of President Lincoln, in the yard of the old
arsenal.</p>

<p>The regard for law and justice which usually
governs in a Civil Court had no holding in the proceedings
of a Military Commission, where the decisions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
of the Court were rendered in accordance with the
opinions of the Judge Advocate, who admitted or rejected
testimony as he thought it affected the case.
Consequently persons whose testimony was considered
vital for the defense, were not allowed to testify, while
witnesses for the prosecution were permitted to give
their evidence, no matter how inconsistent or manifestly
false it was.</p>

<p>In a letter dated August 17th, 1868, to the <i>National
Intelligencer</i>, Robert Ould, who was Confederate
States Agent of Exchange, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I was named by poor Wirz as a witness in his behalf.
The summons was issued by Chipman, the Judge
Advocate of the Military Court. I obeyed the summons
and was in attendance upon the court for some
ten days.... Early in the morning of
the day on which I expected to give my testimony I
received a note from Chipman requiring me to surrender
my subpoena. I refused, as it was my protection
in Washington.... I engaged, however, to
appear before the court and did so the same morning.
The Judge Advocate endorsed on my subpoena these
words: &#8216;The within subpoena is hereby revoked; the
person named is discharged from further attendance.&#8217;
I have got the curious document before me now,
signed with the name of &#8216;N. P. Chipman, Colonel,&#8217; etc.
I intend to keep it, if I can, as the evidence of the
first case <i>in any court of any sort</i>, where a witness who
was summoned <i>for the defense</i> was dismissed <i>by the
prosecution</i>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Rev. Father Whelan, of Savannah, Ga., a venerable
Catholic priest, who had been in the habit of visiting
and ministering to the prisoners at Andersonville, went
to Washington, as a witness. He was asked by the
prosecuting attorney what he knew, and after telling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
his observations at the prison, he was told he was not
wanted and could go home.</p>

<p>In an old diary of mine, I find this entry:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;A man named Marini was in the store to-day. He
was called as a witness in the Wirz case. He had
been a prisoner at Andersonville. He said many of
the witnesses had sworn falsely. Some swore he had
been bitten by bloodhounds. This he said was false;
that he had shown them his person to prove there were
no marks of wounds. &#8216;If I had been torn by the dogs
as they swore I had,&#8217; said he, &#8216;would there not have
been at least some scars to show it?&#8217; He said that at
the time some of the witnesses swore Wirz had shot
prisoners, Wirz was not at Andersonville, but was
absent from the post for about four weeks on surgeon&#8217;s
certificate, suffering from gangrene; that the accounts
of the prisoners being killed by Wirz were false.
Marini was in the employ of the United States Government
as a spy during the war. He said that one
of the witnesses swore he had been sick during the
whole time he was at Andersonville. &#8216;So he should
have been,&#8217; said Marini; &#8216;he didn&#8217;t wash himself the
whole time he was there; he was too lazy.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>The star witness for the prosecution was the Marquis
De la Baume, who claimed to be a grand nephew
of Lafayette. He testified to the &#8220;individual killing&#8221;
or murder &#8220;committed by Wirz.&#8221; Before the conclusion
of the trial he was, <i>on the recommendation of
the members of the Military Commission</i>, appointed
to a clerkship in the Interior Department at Washington.
He was afterward recognized as a deserter from
the Seventh New York Regiment, and his name was
plain Felix Oeser. When this fact became known he
was dismissed from his office, a few weeks after the
execution of Wirz. There was no further need of
his services.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>Another witness against Wirz was John Rainbow.
In September, 1894, he was sentenced in Union County
(N. J.) Court to one year in State Prison for stealing
a watch. A petition, signed by Grand Army men,
was presented to the court and this sentence was revoked
and he was committed to the county jail for six
months.</p>

<p>In the charges upon which Wirz was condemned
and hung were thirteen specifications of men said to
have been murdered by him, but though all the most
minute details were given, it is a singular fact that
there is not given the <i>name</i> of any one of these
persons&mdash;in every instance mentioned, it is &#8220;name unknown.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the first specification Wirz was charged with conspiring
with Jefferson Davis, James A. Seddon,
Howell Cobb, and others, named and unnamed, &#8220;to
injure and impair the health and destroy the lives,&#8221;
etc., &#8220;of soldiers in the service of the United States.&#8221;
On this charge Wirz was declared guilty and hanged.
Why were none of the other conspirators punished?
Did he conspire alone?</p>

<p>Had the case been brought in any Civil Court&mdash;no
matter where&mdash;it would have been thrown out of
court.</p>

<p>What must have been the agony of this poor victim,
sitting in the courtroom, day after day, and week after
week, listening to the recital of the horrible tales, describing
him as a fiend incarnate, by wretches who
were swearing his life away. He looked in vain upon
the faces around for a glance of pity, but on all sides
he met the glaring eyes of men thirsting for his
blood.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>Foiled in their efforts to incriminate Jefferson Davis,
his cruel and vindictive persecutors determined to
wreck their vengeance upon Wirz, poor and friendless,
whom they had in their power, and who had rejected
their proposal to purchase his life by swearing falsely
against Jefferson Davis.</p>

<p>Major Richard B. Winder, M.D., and dean of the
Baltimore Dental College, was a prisoner in the Old
Capitol, Washington, at the time of Wirz&#8217;s imprisonment
and execution. A statement of his in regard to
an occurrence which took place the evening before
Wirz was executed has been extensively published,
but an extract from it will not be out of place here:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;A night or two before Wirz&#8217;s execution&mdash;early in
the evening, I saw several male individuals (looking
like gentlemen) pass into Wirz&#8217;s cell. I was naturally
on the <i>qui vive</i> to know the meaning of this unusual
visitation, and was hoping and expecting too that it
might be a reprieve&mdash;for even at that time I was not
prepared to believe that so foul a judicial murder
would be perpetrated. I think&mdash;indeed, I am quite
certain&mdash;there were three of them. Wirz came to his
door, which was immediately opposite mine, and I
gave him a look of inquiry, which was at once understood.
He said: &#8216;These men have just offered me
my liberty if I will testify against Mr. Davis, and
criminate him with the charges against the Andersonville
Prison. I told them that I could not do this,
as I neither knew Mr. Davis personally, officially or
socially, but if they expected with the offer of my
miserable life to purchase me to treason and treachery
to the South they had undervalued me.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>In reply to a letter of inquiry from Hon. Jefferson
Davis, Rev. Father Boyle wrote:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;On the evening before the day of the execution
of Major Wirz a man visited me, on the part of a
cabinet officer, to inform me that Major Wirz would
be pardoned if he would implicate Jefferson Davis in
the cruelties at Andersonville. No names were given
by this emissary, and, upon my refusing to take any
action in the matter, he went to Mr. Louis Schade,
counsel for Major Wirz, with the same purpose and
with a like result.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_140.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">REV. F. E. BOYLE<br />

Pastor of St. Peter&#8217;s R. C. Church, Washington, D. C.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I visited Major Wirz the next morning he
told me that the same proposal had been made to him
and had been rejected with scorn. The Major was
very indignant, and said that while he was innocent of
the charges for which he was about to suffer death,
he would not purchase his liberty by perjury and a
crime such as was made the condition of his freedom.</p>

<p>&#8220;I attended the major to the scaffold, and he died
in the peace of God and praying for his enemies. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
know that he was indeed innocent of all the cruel
charges on which his life was sworn away, and I was
edified by the Christian spirit in which he submitted
to his persecutors.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">&#8220;Yours very truly,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">F. E. Boyle</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Wirz spent the greater part of the night before his
execution in writing, but slept for a few hours before
daylight and awoke cheerful and refreshed. He was
calm and self-possessed and had left nothing undone.
His own books, as well as those borrowed, were all
neatly done up and left for delivery to the proper
parties. His diary was completed up to the last day.</p>

<p>He felt keenly the abuse that was heaped upon him.
As he bade farewell to his old associate, Captain R. H.
Winder, he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... &#8220;Promise me, if you live, to do all in your
power to wipe out this awful stain upon my character.
Make my name and character stand as bright before
the world as it did when you first knew me. Promise
me you will do something to assist my wife.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Winder turned his face away to hide his tears, as
he replied: &#8220;Captain, I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the daily newspapers, after relating this
parting with Winder, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Wirz passed on down the stairs, out between the
files of men facing outward, up to the scaffold, showing
something in his face and step which in a better
man might have passed for heroism.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>How contemptible! His courage and fortitude
shone out in spite of the infamous position in which
his enemies sought to place him, but even the eyes
blinded by prejudice and the callous hearts around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
him could not fail to note, though they could not appreciate,
the lofty spirit of the man.</p>

<p>From the little room in the third story, designated
&#8220;No. 9&mdash;Wirz, H., Captain C. S. A.,&#8221; he was marched
to the scaffold, erected in one corner of the prison
yard. Here he took a seat on a small stool, immediately
under the gaping noose swaying over him. A
soldier stood at shoulder arms on either corner of the
platform, and four companies, one each from the
195th and 214th Pennsylvania, and two from the 9th
Regiment of Hancock&#8217;s Corps, formed a hollow square
around the scaffold. Fathers Boyle and Wiget never
left his side until the last moment. Indeed, when the
noose was adjusted his face wore a smile and he was
still talking to Father Boyle.</p>

<p>For eighteen minutes he was compelled to sit and
listen to the reading of the findings and sentence&mdash;the
enumeration of the crimes with which he was charged,
while on the housetops and in the branches of the trees
in the Capitol grounds men and boys crowded, all
eager to witness the ghastly spectacle; and their inhuman
shouts, and brutal jests about the &#8220;dead-line,&#8221;
pendant above him, could be heard by Wirz, who sat
apparently calm and unmoved, save when amid the
groans and outcries, a voice called out &#8220;Hang the
scoundrel.&#8221; As this reached his ears he turned quickly,
with a defiant look in the direction from which the
sound proceeded, then, giving a cool glance on the
surroundings, he resumed his self-command, giving his
undivided attention to his spiritual advisers.</p>

<p>At the close of the reading Major Russell asked
Wirz if he wished to say anything to the public before
the execution. He replied: &#8220;I have nothing to say,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
only that I am innocent, and will die like a man,
my hopes being in the future. I go before my God,
the Almighty God, and he will judge between me and
you.&#8221; At twenty minutes to eleven o&#8217;clock Sylvester
Ballon kicked away the prop and Henry Wirz passed
from life to the dark valley of the shadow of death.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_143.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">St. Aloysius R. C. Church, Washington, D. C.</p>

<p>I saw Father Wiget a few hours after the execution.
He, with Father Boyle, had stood with Wirz on
the scaffold&mdash;had clasped his hand just as he was
about to be launched into eternity. He had been with
him through the mockery of a trial, and when I saw
him his breast was filled with emotion. He said: &#8220;Oh!
he was a brave man!&#8221; He had stood by him as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
rabble thirsting for his blood, like the cruel Jews,
cried out &#8220;Crucify him! Crucify him!&#8221; and he knew
the man was innocent of the crimes imputed to him.
&#8220;He was a brave man&#8221;&mdash;the good old priest could say
no more; his heart was touched, and his feelings too
deep for mere words. Between what is felt and what
is expressed there is often an immeasurable distance.
It is impossible at times to give expression in words
to the most touching&mdash;to the most beautiful emotions
of the heart.</p>

<p>In Wirz&#8217;s letters to his wife there is an amount of
pathos&mdash;a bitter, yet mournful wailing. The soft
notes which he touches with trembling fingers will
strike a sympathetic chord in hearts not utterly lost
to all sense of tenderness or humanity.</p>

<p>A letter written by his wife just after she had
learned of the termination of her husband&#8217;s trial would
in itself show how false and malicious were the assertions
of sensational newspapers that there was no
kindly feeling between them. After speaking of her
distress at the necessity of leaving him at that critical
moment, and telling him not to despair&mdash;that all would
come out right&mdash;she speaks of their past happiness,
and cannot believe the authorities will tear them apart;
that if the members of the court only knew how much
they suffered, a pardon would be granted him. The
letter concludes as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Dear husband, bear up bravely, whatever your fate
may be. If I could but see you for one short hour I
should be much comforted. I cannot describe to you
on paper the distress of my mind. May angels watch
and protect you from all harm, is the constant prayer
of your loving wife.&#8221;</p>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>In Wirz&#8217;s last letter to his wife and children are the
sad, soft breathings from a bosom filled with the
warmest affection and anxious solicitude for their
welfare:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">&#8220;Old Capitol Prison, &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
Washington, D. C., Nov. 10, 1865.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dearest Wife and Children: When these lines
reach you the hand who wrote them will be stiff and
cold. In a few hours from now I shall be dead. Oh,
if I could express myself as I wish, if I could tell you
what I have suffered when I thought about you and
the children! I must leave you without the means to
live, to the miseries of a cold cruel world. Lise, do
not grieve, do not despair; we will meet again in a
better world. Console yourself, think as I do&mdash;that
I die innocent. Who knows better than you that all
these tales of cruelties and murders are infamous lies,
and why should I not say it? A great many do call
me hard-hearted, because I tell them that I am not
guilty, that I have nothing to confess. Oh, think for
a moment how the thought that I must suffer and die
innocent must sustain me in the last terrible hour;
that when I shall stand before my Maker I can say,
&#8216;Lord, of these things you know I am not guilty. I
have sinned often and rebelled against Thee, oh, let
my unmerited death be an atonement.&#8217; Lise, I die
reconciled. I die, I hope, as a Christian. This is
His holy will that I should die, and therefore let
us say with Christ, &#8216;Thy will, O Lord, be done.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly know what to say. Oh, let me beg you,
do not give way to despair. Think that I am gone
to my Father, to your Father, to the Father of all,
and that there I hope to meet you. Live for the dear
children. Oh, do take good care of Cora. Kiss her
for me. Kiss Susan and Cornelia, and tell them to
live so that we may meet again in the heaven above
the skies: tell them that my last thoughts, my last
prayer shall be for them.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>Then follow some words of advice with regard to
the schooling of the children, and to the future life,

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;God bless you all and protect you. God give you
what you stand in need of, and grant that you all so
live that when you die you can say, Lord, Thou callest

<h2 class="nobreak">EXTRACTS FROM DIARY OF MAJOR WIRZ</h2>
</div>


<p>From the diary kept by Wirz while in prison during
the progress of the trial, I make a few extracts, yet
enough to show the manhood, the nobility of the man:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">&#8220;Old Capitol Prison, Oct. 1, 1865.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything is quiet around me. No sound but the
measured steps of the sentinel in the corridor can be
heard. The man who is sitting in my room is nodding
in his chair. Poor, short-sighted mortals that we all
are! This man is here to watch me, to prevent any
attempt I might make to take my own life. My life&mdash;what
is it worth to anyone except myself and my
poor family, that they should be so anxious? I think
I understand it very well, they are afraid I might cheat
them and the public at large from having their revenge,
and giving, at the same time, the masses the
benefit of seeing a man hanged. If this is all, they are
welcome. I have no desire to live; perhaps there never
was a more willing victim dragged to the scaffold
than I am. Why should I desire to live? A beggar,
crippled, and with my health and spirit broken&mdash;why,
oh why, should I desire to live? For the sake of my
family? My family will do as well without me as
with me. Instead of providing for and taking care
of them, I would be a burden to them. And still,
knowing all that, why do I not put an end to my life?
Because, in the first instance, what I suffer now is the
Will of God. GOD&mdash;how much is not in this word&mdash;what
a tower of strength, of consolation! Yes,
Heavenly Father, if it was not Thy will I would not
be a prisoner. I would not be looked at, spoken of as
a monster, such as the world has never seen and never
will see. If that what I suffer now was not put on me
by you for some wise purpose I would be as free as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
the bird in the air. Thou and I&mdash;we two alone know
that I am innocent of those terrible charges. Thou
and I&mdash;we both know that I never took the life of a
fellow man&mdash;that I never caused a man to suffer and
die in consequence of ill-treatment inflicted by me;
and still I am tried for murder. Men have sworn that
they saw me do it; they have called on Thee to witness
that they would tell the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, and still they told a lie&mdash;a lie
as black as hell itself. Why did you not send a thunderbolt
from the high heavens&mdash;why, oh God, why?
Because it is Thy holy will, and in humility I kiss the
rod with which Thou seest proper to chastise me.</p>

<p>&#8220;The second reason why I did not destroy a life
which is a burden to me, is because I owed it to myself,
my family, my relatives, even to the world at
large, to prove that there never existed a man so
utterly devoid of all humanity, such a fiend incarnate,
as it has been attempted to prove me to be. I see very
well that I have no earthly show&mdash;that I am a doomed
man; but thanks be to God that I am enabled to say
with holy Stephanus: Lord, lay not this sin to their
charge. They judge from what they hear and I must
abide by it.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Oct. 2, 1865.</i>&mdash;Another day has passed. I am tired
and worn out; whichever way I turn my eyes everything
looks gloomy and dark. Can it be possible that,
knowing what I do know, I shall fall a victim. But
why do I doubt? What right have I to grumble, as if
it were a thing unheard of in history that men suffered
the death of a felon as innocent of the crime alleged
as I am; and if I dare to make a comparison between
our Saviour and myself, did not He also suffer death?
True, he died as an atonement for a sinful world; true,
He died willingly; He had a holy mission to fulfill;
but I? Why should I die? I can only say, because
it is God&#8217;s will. Oh, God! Our Heavenly Father,
give me grace, give me the power to bear the cross
which Thou seest fit to lay on me. Have I not often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
sinned against Thee, and neglected the holy commandments?
If I suffer now innocently can I, dare I say,
I never offended Thee? Therefore be calm, my poor
heart. Give thyself into His hands and say, Abba!
Father!</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Oct. 3. 1865.</i>&mdash;What a mockery is this trial. I feel
at times as if I ought to speak out aloud and tell them,
why do you wrong yourself and me too? Why not
end the game at once? Take me and hang me and be
done with it. A few days I asked to arrange my
defense; it was refused on the ground that I had ample
time. Ample time, indeed! May the day be far distant
for General Wallace when he may plead with
grim death for a day, and receive the answer, No!
I just received a note from my wife, saying she had
tried in every way to see me, but impossible. She says
she is going to her mother in Kentucky, and hopes
to be able to do more for me there than in remaining
here. Poor, deluded woman, what do you expect to
accomplish, what can you do for me but pray? Oh,
what a consolation it is to a person in a situation like
mine, that there is in the wide, wide world at least one
being that will pray for me. Yes, pray; but pray for
thyself; the road thou hast to travel is a hard one;
when thou findest out that when you pressed my hand
two weeks ago, when thy lips touched mine, it was in
all probability the last time <i>then</i> dost thou need all
the comfort prayer can give. May God bless you, and
take care of you and the dear, dear children&mdash;I must
end. Everything swims before my eyes&mdash;God, oh,
God, have mercy upon me.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Oct. 4. 1865.</i>&mdash;What a mockery this trial is. They
say that they are anxious that I should have justice
done to me, and then when a witness is put on the
stand to give testimony they try everything to break
him down; if they cannot do it, they try to assail his
private character. When they had their own witnesses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
up, they not alone were allowed to state everything I
said, everything I done, but even what they heard
others say that I had said so and so, done such and
such things, and now, when I wish to prove by my
witnesses what I also said and done, it is said it is
inadmissible. I might just as well be put on the stand
myself, as if I had said those things now and not a
year ago, when I had no idea that I should be held to
account hereafter. But so the world goes, and all I
can say is, Oh, God, give me strength to bear with
patience and humility what Thou seest fit to put on
me. Be Thou my judge.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Oct. 5, 1865.</i>&mdash;When I left the courtroom to-day,
I heard a lady remark: &#8216;I wish I could shoot out his
eyes,&#8217; meaning me. Foolish woman! The time will
come when my earthly eyes are shut up; are you in
such a hurry? But it is very natural that people do
think and pass such remarks. For weeks and weeks
they have heard men testify to cruelties done by me
and now a very slim chance have I to contradict these
statements. It seems to me as if General Wallace
had a personal spite against me or my counsel, or he
would not act the way he does. If he has one against
me, I pity him that he has not more magnanimity of
soul than to crush me in such an unheard-of arbitrary
way; if he has a spite against my counsel, it is a
cowardly act to do as he does, for in the end I am the
sufferer, and not my counsel.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Oct. 6, 1865.</i>&mdash;Another day passed. I wish the
trial was over. I wonder what unheard-of resolutions
the court will pass again to-morrow. I did not feel
it so keenly to-day as I felt it other days, and I have to
thank God for it in permitting me to partake of the
Holy Communion this morning. I feel less contempt
for those who are sitting in judgment over me. If it
is God&#8217;s will to open their eyes and hearts, He alone
has the power to do it. I am certain that none of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
court, nor the Judge Advocate, considers and believes
me guilty. They all know that the whole thing is a
farce. Cruelties have been committed at Andersonville:
some one has to suffer for it; they have me;
therefore, I am the one, <i>voila tout</i>.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">MONUMENT AT ANDERSONVILLE</h2>
</div>


<p>After more than forty years had passed an act of
tardy justice was performed, when a monument was
unveiled at Andersonville, in memory of the man who
was the victim of cruel injustice and put to death for
crimes of which he was innocent.</p>

<p>The monument is a shaft of gray and white, 35
feet in height and simple in design. The base is
formed by four square slabs of stone superimposed in
the form of a pyramid. Above this are two heavy
blocks of stone, on the four sides of which are carved
the following inscriptions:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">North Side</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;When time shall have softened passion and prejudice,
when reason shall have stripped the mask from
misrepresentation, then Justice, holding evenly her
scales, will require much of past censure and praise
to change places.</p>

<p>&#8220;Discharging his duty with such humanity as the
harsh circumstances of the times and the policy of the
foe permitted, Captain Wirz became at last the victim
of a misdirected popular clamor. He was arrested in
time of peace while under the protection of a parole,
tried by a military commission of a service to which
he did not belong and condemned to ignominious death
on charges of excessive cruelty to Federal prisoners.
He indignantly spurned a pardon proffered on condition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
that he would incriminate President Davis and
thus exonerate himself from charges of which both
were innocent.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FAIRFAX COURT HOUSE RAID AND CAPTURE
OF GENERAL STOUGHTON</h2>
</div>


<p>As detailed accounts of this famous raid have been
so often published I will not repeat the story here.
A little incident connected with it, however, may be
new to some of my readers:</p>

<p>In October, 1906, there was a reunion of the old-time
Telegraphers&#8217; and Historical Association held in
Washington, D. C. From a special dispatch to the
<i>Baltimore Sun</i> of October 11th, I take the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Another interesting war-time telegrapher attending
the Convention is R. F. Weitbrec, now a wealthy contractor
of Denver. In March, 1863, he was operator
for General Stoughton, whose headquarters were at
Fairfax Court House, with several thousand men.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hooker had more than 100,000 men between us
and Lee&#8217;s army,&#8217; he said to-day, &#8216;and we felt as safe
as if we were in Boston. My office and living quarters
were in a tent in the yard of the General&#8217;s headquarters.
About three o&#8217;clock one rainy night I was rudely
awakened by some one playing &#8220;ride a cock horse&#8221; on
my stomach. There had been several gay young lieutenants
around my camp who made a practice of coming
to my tent at unseemly hours and having fun with
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;In the darkness I mistook the person on my
stomach for one of these, and tried to throw him off.
Instantly my throat was clutched and I felt a cold muzzle
against my temple.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> That moment a light flared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
up and my intruders were two Confederate cavalrymen,
who told me they were Mosby&#8217;s men, who had
gobbled up a General with a lot of horses and prisoners.
One of them whittled my telegraph instrument
into junk. I was taken out, mounted on a horse and
taken on one of the wildest rides ever experienced by
a human being. There were only a dozen or two of
the cavalrymen. They had nearly 100 horses and
prisoners. Besides, they were surrounded by thousands
of our soldiers and didn&#8217;t stop for sentries, except
to grab and take them along. By daybreak they
had us outside the Federal lines, and breakfast didn&#8217;t
come for anybody in the party until late that evening.
I spent several months in prison, and when exchanged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
went West, where Indian hunting proved tamer than
pastoral life in Virginia during the war?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_155.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE GUNNELL HOUSE, FAIRFAX COURT HOUSE<br />

General Stoughton&#8217;s Headquarters</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In &#8220;Historic Records of the Fifth New York
Cavalry,&#8221; by Rev. Louis N. Boudrye, Chaplain of the
Regiment, I find the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;<i>March 9th.</i>&mdash;About 3 o&#8217;clock <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> Mosby and his
gang, led by Sergeant James F. Ames, formerly of
Company L, of this regiment, having safely passed
the pickets, entered Fairfax Court House. Without
scarcely firing a shot they captured 50 fine horses
and about 30 prisoners, including Brigadier-General
Stoughton and Captain Barker of the Fifth New York
Cavalry. The brigade was sent in pursuit of the
dashing party, each regiment taking different routes,
but they returned at night unsuccessful, the Fifth
New York having gone to Herndon Station. Such a
raid, five or six miles within our lines, resulting in
such a heavy loss to us, reflects very uncreditably upon
some of our military leaders, while it shows how wily
a foe we have to contend with.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>When Company F, Mosby&#8217;s Battalion, was organized,
James F. Ames, usually spoken of as &#8220;Big
Yankee,&#8221; was chosen as second lieutenant. He was
killed October 9th, 1864, at Mrs. Shacklett&#8217;s gate on
the road to Piedmont (now called Delaplane) by a
Federal scout who came out with one of the parties
from Rectortown that morning, and while this scout
was rifling the corpse, he was killed by one of Mosby&#8217;s
men, Lud. Lake.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[B]</a> Colonel William P. Wood was born in Alexandria,
Va., on the 11th of March, 1820, and died at the Soldiers&#8217;
Home, Washington, D. C., March 20, 1903.</p>

<p>He was a veteran of the Mexican and Civil Wars, and
one of the survivors of the Walker filibustering expedition
to Nicaragua. When the Mexican War broke out
he enlisted in the mounted rifles under Sam. H. Walker,
the noted Texan Ranger. After serving out his term, he
returned to Washington and married a Maryland lady.</p>

<p>When Stanton became Secretary of War he appointed
Wood to be Superintendent of the Military Prisons of
the District of Columbia, and concentrated the &#8220;State&#8221;
prisoners and all others in the Old Capitol, to which was
afterward added the Carroll Prison (Duff Green&#8217;s Row).</p>

<p>Wood was the first Chief of the United States Secret
Service when it became part of the Treasury Department.</p>

<p>At the time of his death a bill was before Congress
to pay him $15,000 for his services in the famous Brockway
case. Wood captured the author and secured the plate
of this noted 7.30 Bond counterfeit. The work on this
bond was so well executed that it passed as genuine
until Jay Cooke &amp; Co. forwarded $84,000 to the United
States Treasury for redemption.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[C]</a> When General Pope was placed in command of the
Army of Virginia, he issued a General Order to his soldiers
which virtually gave them unbridled license to plunder
and destroy, by depriving the citizens of the section
of country through which they were passing of even
the trifling amount of protection afforded by safeguards,
as may be seen by the copy of the Order here shown:</p>

<p><i>General Orders No. 13.</i>&mdash;Hereafter no guards will be
placed over private houses or private property of any
description whatever. Commanding officers are responsible
for the conduct of the troops under their command,
and the articles of war and the regulations of the army
provide ample means for restraining them to the full extent
required for discipline and efficiency. Soldiers were
called into the field to do battle against the enemy, and
it is not expected that their force and energy shall be
wasted in protecting private property of those most hostile
to the government. No soldier serving in this army
shall be hereafter employed on such service.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[D]</a> Belle Boyd had a most remarkable career. Her life
story, with the account of her daring exploits, is more
like romance than reality. She was born in Martinsburg,
Va., in May, 1843, and was little more than a school
girl when the war broke out. Her father, John Read
Boyd, was an officer in the Confederate army. The act
which first brought her into notice was the shooting by
her of a Federal soldier who assailed her mother&mdash;she
seized her father&#8217;s pistol and shot him dead. She then
threw all her energy into the struggle. On information
furnished by her, Stonewall Jackson drove Banks out
of the Shenandoah Valley, for which service Jackson
sent a special dispatch thanking her. Her daring led to
her capture and imprisonment in the Old Capitol for
three months. She was then exchanged for Colonel
Corcoran, of the 69th New York Regiment. She went
South, was commissioned as Captain in the Confederate
army, and served as courier and in the Secret Service.</p>

<p>After the battle of Gettysburg she went home, was
arrested and sent to Carroll Prison, Washington, D. C.,
where she was confined for seven months, and sentenced
to be shot, but through the efforts of influential parties
she was exchanged for General Nathan Goff, of West
Virginia. She afterward sailed from Wilmington, N. C.,
in the steamer <i>Greyhound</i>, with important dispatches for
England, but after a chase the steamer was captured by
the Federal cruiser <i>Connecticut</i>, and Belle was brought
back, court-martialed in Boston, and again sentenced to
be shot. Her sentence was afterward commuted, and
she was escorted to the Canadian border by a deputy
marshal, with the understanding that if she ever returned
to the United States she would be put to death.</p>

<p>She died in Kilbourn, Wis., in June, 1890.</p>

<p>Superintendent Wood, of the Old Capitol Prison, is
reported as saying of her: &#8220;Her face was not what
would be called pretty&mdash;her features indicated firmness
and daring, but her figure was perfect, and a splendid
specimen of feminine health and vigor. She was a good
talker, very persuasive, and the most persistent and enthusiastic
Rebel who ever came under my charge. Her
father sent her, from time to time, large sums of money,
most of which was expended for the comfort of the Confederate
prisoners in the Old Capitol.&#8221;</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
